I'm 'into' politics against for the first time since 2004.

No one beyond your friends will ever like you or pay attention to you.
It is just what you are.
There is always a fact of reality that can wear down your desire for something
until you consider yourself wiser, for not wanting it any more.

We should burn all of the mountains and use the energy to power computers.

Next door, they seem to be digging a basement by hand.  On the first floor,
there's a nice apartment.  On the second and third floors, there's a coffee
packaging operation.  On the fourth floor, there's a mysterious silent digital
agency.  We share the fifth floor with a lingerie company.  There's a nice
apartment on the sixth floor.  I haven't tried to access the roof.  

What makes writing "seductive"?  By seductive writing I mean writing that you
want to keep reading, and also writing that you think about after you stop
reading.  Essentially, writing that you want.  Here are some observations:

1) Two key aspects of seductive writing are the creation of tension, and
effectively embodying the reader within the story.  Tension doesn't necessarily
have to seem "tense".  The tension I'm referring to is the tension that compels
you to wake up in the morning and continue living your life.  There are certain
things that pull you forward.  You desire the next thing.  

Embodiment is a big part of making tension work.  If the reader can feel
themselves in the story, it's a lot easier to create tension.  The reader is
going to feel the natural tension of an unexplored part of an environment or
relationship.

2) Writing can always fall flat.  Seductive writing is very temporal and
subjective.  Not much is universally seductive.  Seductive writing can be bad,
or it can be good.
