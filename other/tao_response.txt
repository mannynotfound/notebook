Tao: Tao, from your reply, it seems like you believe that there is a "bigger picture", a more rational perspective that you have access to, and that those who disagree with you are thinking about the issue in a reactive "us vs them" way.  And the issue here is rape.  Sometimes, when people band together against a certain idea or person, it is due to an "us vs. them" mentality, as you described.  Other times, it is because those people deeply believe that the discreditation and removal of that person or idea is necessary to create a better world.  Which situation do you think this is?  I think I personally have a number of good reasons to despise you.  The rehabilitation of a rapist takes a lower priority than the rehabilitation of the suvivor.  Or victim.   

What the article mainly 

- seems like tao believes he has access to a more rational perspective, thinking about "what's best in a few centuries".  is this really what you are concerned about, here?
- he accuses his commenters of having an "us vs them" mentality: you say that we are "unaware that this is exactly the wrong way to think about things"
