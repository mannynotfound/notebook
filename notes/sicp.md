# Structure And Interpretation of Computer Programming Notes

Lecture One:

- Computer Science is not really a science, and is only tangentially related to
  computers.  Geometry was originally about surveying land with surveying tools.

- Concerned with procedures, not just declarative knowledge.

- A form of engineering of the ideal, rather than of reality.  The constraints
  we face are those of our own mind.

- 'Detail suppression.'

- 'We're going to express in Lisp the way that Lisp itself works.'

Tools to manage complexity:
- Black box abstraction.  Allows for composition of procedures.
- Conventional interfaces.  Generic operations, large scale structure,
  aggregates (streams).
- Metalinguistic abstraction.  Making new languages.
