INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER GRAPHICS:


8/21/14:

Three basic parts of a ray tracer:
    1. ray generation (computes origin and direction of each ray)
    2. ray intersection (finds object intersecting the ray)
    3. shading (computes pixel color)

for pixel in pixels:
    compute viewing ray
    find first object hit by ray and its surface normal
    set pixel color value computer from hit point, light, and surface

Parallel Projection: all rays are perpendicular to the view plane
    points moved along "projection direction" until they hit the image plane
    if image plane is perpendicular to view plane, orthogonal, else oblique
    should look up some examples of what an orthographic rendering would look
    
"You may have learned about the artistic conventions of three-point-perspective,
a system for manually constructing perspective views.  A surprising fact about
perspective is that all the rules of perspective drawing will be followed
automatically is we follow the simple mathematical rule underlying perspective:
objects are projected directly towards the eye, and they are drawn where they
meet a view plane in front of the eye."

Surface Normal: vector perpendicular to the surface
3D Parametric Lines: in graphics we use vectors because their forms are more
intuitive than the cartesian forms.  
Also easier to support in code.
