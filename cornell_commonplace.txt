I read and took notes on Joyce in the library until I was sick of it or the library closed, and I went to read outside the marble Goldwin-Smith Hall.  
It was a rich twilight and there were a lot of students on the lawn for the orientation week concert.  It was a dj called...mario something.
I tried focusing on reading until the music started and then I started milling around looking at people.
Reading had been pretty good.  I had learned about ... a saint who died due to indigestion.  I felt the knowledge might be necessary to finally be learning, like calculus, collegiate.
Two girls stopped me, a somewhat attractive white girl with short hair and a chubby Asian, probably Korean.  
"Can you take us to the bathroom?" the Asian girl said.  "We really need your help."
They seemed drunk or weird.  
"Oh, yeah...I think I know where there is one.  Follow me."
They laughed and followed me through the crowd.  They told me their names and said they went to Ithaca college.  They asked what I was reading.
I led them accross the quad into the fine arts library where there happened to be a library.  I felt on guard.  I liked the white girl, she looked a little like a skunk because she had died hair.
She seemed to think her friend was funny.
"You like them nerdy" said the skunk girl to the chubby Asian girl, so I could barely hair, laughing as the Asian girl went into the bathroom.'
I felt good about this.  I felt a little dazed from reading all day and I just sort of smiled and felt calm and sun melted.
