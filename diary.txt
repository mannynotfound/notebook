I think I've had enough for today.
Time for ten hours of sleep.
Goodbye paper notebook.  I liked you, you started it.

Broke up with Isabel today.  It was a very miserable thing to do.  I felt as bad as when as I thought I was going to have to quit Cornell.  
I really hope I'm doing the right thing.  I may be asking for too much but...  I may be.  
Maybe I will now go back to feeling very lonely and stressed and unloved for the rest of the summer.  Or maybe things will be even better and you will address issues on your hiearchy. 
I already feel more or less okay.  Talking with her does feel good...better than talking to Alina, or any other of your friends really.  That will be tricky...you have to replace her.  She...has to replace you.
She said some pretty mean things about you.  She said you were immature and don't care about other people, and that you thought you were living in a tao lin novel but that you're not that good of a writer and not that cute.  And then she said fuck you and left.  These things are all sort of dull stings.  And she fucking came back.  Why do they always come back.  I do not go back...not unless...I was really in love I think.
None of those things she said really _hurt_ now they are things you already know...they are facts that are in flux.  Facts in flux.  It was more that now I see how she sees me and I don't like that.  
Although I guess I think of Isabel in terms of attractiveness a fair amount of the time.  It's not normally the dominant way I think about her but it is definitely a way.  
It goes back to the need to .... do the things...live the dream.
But you need to work from the top of your cute little hiearchy downward.  That's the only way you don't fall apart before you realize your selfish dreams and "goals".  Images.  If you focus only on the images you will fall apart stupidly.

I hope 
Isabel
is okay.
 
I get this image of how Al Ly sees me...strange, maybe typical, but weird, Bushwick male, horny.

isabrl: seems like a bad dream but is real life.
fuck
Got a haircut and ran this morning.  Getting to work at 10:30.  But still fuck definitely.
im goimg to tell myself that i didnt make a mistake, and believe it.
your time is limited and shes notthe one, not now or in the long run.
one possible reason breakups are so sad is that it breaks the usual feeling of ... statis and continuity, of endless progressive nights and long alcohol/drug/movie afternoons, and makes very clear the sob inducing human fact that we are always at some point on a growth/death arc, that all will someday be lost

having your parents and family see your facebook statuses is a good way to keep yourself honest I think.  I one sense knowing they will see will make you afraid.  In one sense that is a good thing.  They have the most complete horizontal knowledge of your life.  They know who you were before you decided to try to be someone else.  Most everything is better than a sad gap growing between you each year until they die.  Fuck that kind of sadness.  It's not inevitable.  In ancient texts it seems like fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, could hunt, work, party, talk together and need not feel a sense of alienation from the people who love them and raised them.  Seems stupidly capitalistic that embarassment or shame would come between us.  I have to believe that whatever differences we have can be worked out or explained no matter how many long days of discussion it takes to convince them.  Or be convinced by them that they know better, and change my mind.  If my writing is going to hurt them I want to think about that while I write it.  Then I will not write hurtful writing for no good reason.  

Maybe this is a privilege of having decent parents...but that is something to be fiercly proud of, I've decided.  Any other feeling towards decent parents seem selfish and stupid and ...
