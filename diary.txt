I think I've had enough for today.
Time for ten hours of sleep.
Goodbye paper notebook.  I liked you, you started it.

Broke up with Isabel today.  It was a very miserable thing to do.  I felt as bad as when as I thought I was going to have to quit Cornell.  
I really hope I'm doing the right thing.  I may be asking for too much but...  I may be.  
Maybe I will now go back to feeling very lonely and stressed and unloved for the rest of the summer.  Or maybe things will be even better and you will address issues on your hiearchy. 
I already feel more or less okay.  Talking with her does feel good...better than talking to Alina, or any other of your friends really.  That will be tricky...you have to replace her.  She...has to replace you.
She said some pretty mean things about you.  She said you were immature and don't care about other people, and that you thought you were living in a tao lin novel but that you're not that good of a writer and not that cute.  And then she said fuck you and left.  These things are all sort of dull stings.  And she fucking came back.  Why do they always come back.  I do not go back...not unless...I was really in love I think.
None of those things she said really _hurt_ now they are things you already know...they are facts that are in flux.  Facts in flux.  It was more that now I see how she sees me and I don't like that.  
Although I guess I think of Isabel in terms of attractiveness a fair amount of the time.  It's not normally the dominant way I think about her but it is definitely a way.  
It goes back to the need to .... do the things...live the dream.
But you need to work from the top of your cute little hiearchy downward.  That's the only way you don't fall apart before you realize your selfish dreams and "goals".  Images.  If you focus only on the images you will fall apart stupidly.

I hope 
Isabel
is okay.
 
I get this image of how Al Ly sees me...strange, maybe typical, but weird, Bushwick male, horny.
