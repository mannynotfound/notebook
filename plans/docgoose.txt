Objective:
The point of the docgoose plan is to deal with the desperation that comes from
not have like... an established going concern business / programming project
that you can attach your name to.  Along with being the writer of something you
want to be the "Creator of _______".  You want to learn how to accomplish
long-term, difficult, no-guarantee-of-success projects that involve multiple
people.  Also you will get lots of practical programming experience that comes
with building "a company" "a website".  Finally, this is an idea that you have
been trying to execute for a while, so it's good to get it off the backlog.

Status: executing

Steps:
7/19/14: learn about Flask/Pyramid (finish that Pyramid tutorial!) DONE 7/25/14
7/21/14: set up personal site / demo app (9/11 thing) on ec2 DONE 8/9/14
7/28/14: develop ORM with set of tests, get cornell class data
8/4/14:  develop a minimual viable GUI (?)
8/11/14: polish GUI, add features (?)
8/16/14: add features and continue polishing (?)

Notes:
Use the notes and todo of the old node app while doing ORM design.
Finish work on the backend before you start working on the js/gui.
Try to minimize JS stuff... will you use client side MVC?  don't let the bad
experience with it last time dissuade you, necessarily.

Updates:
7/23/14: Still haven't finished the Flask/Pyramid Tutorial!  Do today!
7/25/14: Finally finished the Pyramid Turorial.  Not sure how I feel about
Pyramid.  It kind of reminds me of ASP.NET MVC...which may be a good thing.
(Maybe that's just the ORM.)  Anyways, should build that demo app (but also play
with arduino since it's the weekend).
8/9/14: Finished the 9/11 demo app.  Cool...  These things take a lot of time!
Debating on whether it's worth continuing on this plan.  I'm going to think
about it tomorrow and make a definite decision.  In a sense you are "on your
way" with this already...
8/17/14: Decision: going to go forward.  Been thinking about some possible ways
you could "pivot" this project if it doesn't work out.  It goes very well with
your "information retrieval" class as well.  Very important to learn:
    - how to properly do forms, validation, reusable code, views, etc
    - build a proper ETL-type web app with queues, etc (you haven't done this)
    - zen coding
