Objective: Do good at rowing, your last year of rowing.  No regrets.
Status: executing

Steps:

Summer: enough training so that you can pull a sub 1:45 5k on the first
day back.  How to do this: 
    - Row six days a week, no matter what.
    - "Hacking" that particular test by training at high stroke rates, distances
      3k - 8k, or intervals.  Aiming to pull fast splits, regardless.
    - Long distance running or steady state erging, plus pushups / core / yoga.
    - Get a yoga class, maybe the one on the way to the train? 
    - 2x exercise a day, one rowing, one rowing OR something else.

Update 8/9/14:
Have been doing a better job of working out, but not doing enough rowing/5ks.
This coming week is the week to really start.  You should try to go to at least
two yoga classes this week and make sure to do your rowing.  YOU CAN FUCKING DO
THIS.
