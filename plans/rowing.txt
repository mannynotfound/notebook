Objective: Do good at rowing, your last year of rowing.  No regrets.

Steps:

Summer: enough training so that you can pull a sub 1:45 5k on the first
day back.  How to do this: 
    - Row six days a week, no matter what.
    - "Hacking" that particular test by training at high stroke rates, distances
      3k - 8k, or intervals.  Aiming to pull fast splits, regardless.
    - Long distance running or steady state erging, plus pushups / core / yoga.
    - Get a yoga class, maybe the one on the way to the train? 
    - 2x exercise a day, one rowing, one rowing OR something else.
