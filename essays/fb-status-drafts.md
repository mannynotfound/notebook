# Q1 2016 Facebook Status Drafts

I'm 'into' politics again for the first time since 2004.

No one beyond your friends will ever like you or pay attention to you.  It is
just what you are.  There is always some fact of reality that can wear you down 
until you consider yourself wiser, for not wanting it any more.

We should burn all of the mountains and use the energy to power computers.

Next door, they seem to be digging a basement by hand.  On the first floor,
there's a nice apartment.  On the second and third floors, there's a coffee
packaging operation.  On the fourth floor, there's a mysterious silent digital
agency.  We share the fifth floor with a lingerie company.  There's a nice
apartment on the sixth floor.  I haven't tried to access the roof.  

What makes writing "seductive"?  By seductive writing I mean writing that you
want to keep reading, and also writing that you think about after you stop
reading.  Essentially, writing that you want.  Here are some observations:

1) Two key aspects of seductive writing are the creation of tension, and
effectively embodying the reader within the story.  Tension doesn't necessarily
have to seem "tense".  The tension I'm referring to is the tension that compels
you to wake up in the morning and continue living your life.  There are certain
things that pull you forward.  You desire the next thing.  

Embodiment is a big part of making tension work.  If the reader can feel
themselves in the story, it's a lot easier to create tension.  The reader is
going to feel the natural tension of an unexplored part of an environment or
relationship.

2) Writing can always fall flat on its face.  Seductive writing is very temporal
and subjective.  Not much is universally seductive.  Seductive writing can be
bad, or it can be good.

Many people have asked me what my secret is.  My secret is that I get pumped up
for *everything* I do.  In 2016, with a decent stack of genetics, environment,
and consistent effort, it is possible to be happy virtually all of the time.  If
you build your life on top of robust systems like Soylent, Adderall, TalkSpace,
SoulCycle, ReactJS, K******e, GitHub, and Harvest, almost nothing can ruin your
life, except for a few thorny edge cases.  But those are what make life
beautiful :). 

Please enjoy the pain which is unable to avoid. 
As the dog equally studies, the gentleman equally plays. 
If you nap now, you will interpret a dream, but if 
you wake, you will realize it. 
Now drips the saliva, will become tomorrow the tear.
Time passes.

When I ran away from home and my dad had to fly to North Dakota to retrieve me
from a juvenile detention center, he brought me swim trunks, anticipating that
we'd probably have to stay at a hotel.

A famous artist convinced my middle school art teacher to help him with with an
elaborate art project, but refused to give the teacher a little sketch after,
because "it would devalue [the famous artist's] work".

Coors light and keystone light are the exact same beer, just with different
branding.

A child just lost their favorite stuffed animal at a gas station, the family
drove away, leaving it sitting in dirty slush.


Translating things that Series A tech recruiters say:

- "We've transitioned a lot of our site to React" -> "We are trying to manage the
inherent complexity of our views by telling the junior developer to add a new
framework"

- "We have a microservice architecture" -> "No one can agree on anything, so we
give each developer their own ec2 box"

- "Data warehouse" -> "PostgreSQL database"

- "We do don't the typical whiteboard coding interview process" -> "First, you're
going to spend three hours on a homework assignment, and then you will do a
graph search coding problem on a whiteboard in person"

- "This is a really unique opportunity" -> "Most likely, you're going to waste
your time and also get screwed in terms of compensation"

- "We don't care how you get things done, we're really results oriented here" ->
"We need you to sit in our office every day, and sign a contract
devoting the next year of your life to the company"

- "We offer a really good value proposition to our customers" -> "We are mostly
useless in real-world terms"

The "show-don't-tell" school of writing teaches that you should use an
incredibly low-bandwidth channel to communicate images, sounds, smells, and
motions.  It's a futile attempt to increase the immediacy of prose by using the
techniques of film and art.  

Consider that the amount of actionable facts contained in an hour-long
documentary is roughly equivalent to the contents of an essay that you could
read in less than ten minutes.  The immediacy of writing lies in the highly
concise, memorable, and sharable nature of text.

In the past year I think I have undergone a shift from a mode of "becoming" to a
mode of "being".  As a child and young adult, I focused mostly on potentials:
who I would be when I grew up, and the memories I was creating.  Things happened
in real life, but I was mostly interested in them as auguries of a distant,
glittering future.  

The fantasy world was perhaps rightly more important, and I leaped into
relationships when my fantasy world intersected with someone else's.  But in
2015, entropy started to creep into my life.  Since then, every month has
started to "count frantically and seems a cudgel in a fight for happiness
against time".  (Thanks Alina for that quote!)  

The onset of this sort of reality hasn't been a surprise: I feel my parents and
education prepared me well, and I'm not caught off guard.  My friends and I seem
to be facing the challenges of life with some grace, rigor, and aplomb.  

The shift to "becoming" from "being" comes with many pleasures, as anyone who
has ever successfully played their role in the American workplace knows.  It's
not trivial to pull this sort of thing off, and that's probably why getting a
working lunch can be euphoric sometimes.
