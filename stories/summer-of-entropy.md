# Summer of Entropy

An one-legged dachshund jumped over David's feet, chasing a group of other dogs
under the wooden tables in the outdoor area behind the Left Hand Path.  The
owners of the dogs were sitting together in a group, looking fresh from work,
laughing with golden draft beers in their hands.  David was looking for someone
new to talk to, and as he turned to watch the dogs, he found himself facing a
skinny, dark-haired woman.

"Hi, are you here for the tech meetup?" asked David.  She was.  They started
talking, and very soon, they were talking about psychiatric drugs.
