# Summer of Entropy

An one-legged dachshund jumped over Chris's feet, chasing a group of other
sleek, fancy Brooklyn dogs.  The dogs ran circles around the bar's veranda,
amusing the young adults perched on well-organized wooden benches, fresh from
work.  As Chris turned to watch the dogs, he found himself facing a skinny,
dark-haired woman.

"Hi, are you here for the tech meetup?" Chris asked, catching her eyes.

"Yeah," she said.  She seemed happy to talk to Chris, and as it sometimes
happens, in just a few minutes, they were talking about psychiatric drugs.

"I feel a lot more social at these things when I'm on Klonopin," the woman said,
a statement of fact.

"I know what you mean, Lexapro made me like that."

The dogs came around again, and Chris stuck out his hand.  The dachshund stopped
to smell it, giving it a lick.

"I raised a dog like this when I was on Lexapro," Chris said.  "When I was
eighteen, living at home with my parents."

"Oh, I was on Lexapro for a while, but it had weird side effects."

"Really?  If anything the side effects were good, for me."

"Oh yeah?" she said.  "Like sexual stuff?"

"Yeah."

"What?"

"The sexual stuff?  It, uh, made it harder to have an orgasm, but not in a bad
way.  I would just have like, super orgasms," said Chris.

"Anyways," he continued,  "Lexapro worked out really well for me."

The woman introduced herself as Elkie.  Chris confirmed the spelling with her,
E-L-K-I-E, and went to get another beer. 

When he returned, someone was in his place, talking to Elkie about iOS
development.  Chris had been talking to the guy earlier.

"I'll show you my app later," Elkie said.  "I really need feedback on my app."

"Of course," the guy said.

Elkie turned to Chris, a concerned look in her eyes.

"If I show you my app, you have to promise not to steal the idea.  I've been
working super hard on it." 

Fuck, Chris thought.  Was Elkie that naive?  Chris half-heartedly participated
in an earnest, clumsy discussion of Swift's type system, before suggesting that
they go inside for another drink.  On the way inside, Chris knelt to touch the dachshund.

Elkie joined Chris by the antique cash register, waiting for the bartender's
attention.  

"The last time I was at this meetup," said Elkie.  "I was with this guy from
Tinder."

"Oh yeah?"

"I was going to swipe left on him, but then I noticed he had like fifteen
thousand twitter followers."  Chris gave her a disapproving look, smiling.

"How was he?"

"He was okay, he was Jewish."

"Are you Jewish?" asked Chris.  He looked at her again: obviously she was.  

It had taken Chris a while to realize that the girls who talked to him at
parties in college were of a certain type: Jewish, from New York or Long Island,
and almost always wealthy.  Now, in the post-graduate world, he still
appreciated their presence at any social event.

"I grew up in a Hasidic family, but now I'm estranged," said Elkie. 

"Woah, I'm sorry." 

"It's okay, I even eat bacon now.  Are you Jewish?"

"No, not really," said Chris.  "Hasidic?  Is that like Orthodox?"

"Like Orthodox, but a cult, you know, South Williamsburg?  They're awful, and
keep getting worse.  Honestly, I wish the Nazis had finished the job."

"What do you mean by finished the job," said Chris.

"The Holocaust killed almost all of the Hasids, but some of them got away to
Brooklyn."

"Wow, Jesus.  I'm sorry," said Chris.  His skin felt cold.

They got their mixed drinks, and sat down in a large booth, their legs touching.

Chris felt confident, as they started talking again.  It was summer, and he was
wearing over $1000 worth of clothes.   He drew from his own past, finding that
it resonated with Elkie.  They both had exes who lived in castle-like apartments
on the Upper East Side, they both liked department stores, events, and meeting
lots of people. 

Suddenly there was a burst of light: Elkie's umbrella was on fire.  David
reached over to grab a carafe of water and doused the flames.

"Oh my God," said Elkie, fanning herself. 

"The candle," said David, pointing at an extinguished tealight hydroplaning
slowly over the table.

The acrid smell of burnt plastic attracted some other people from the meetup,
who joined Elkie and Chris in the booth.  Elkie repeatedly thanked Chris, who
felt satisfied with himself.

"Are you going to tell us your app idea?" asked the guy from before, when things
had calmed down.

"Okay, okay, yeah," said Elkie, a little flustered.  She got everyone to agree
that dating apps didn't really work.  She told everyone about the Tinder guy
with 15,000 followers, an example of things not working.   But, she said, her
gay friend had set up once, and it had worked.

"So your idea is an app that lets people set up their friends?"

"No, it helps gay people set up their straight friends."

The group laughed and asked clever questions, all with the implicit assumption
that this app, the actual software of it, would never exist.

"I see an issue," said Chris.  "What's the incentive for the gay matchmakers?
Do they get to see the messages or something?"

Elkie more or less ignored Chris's question, and continued making the case for
her app, the faces of the other programmers hovering in the darkness.

"What about bi guys?" said someone.  "Where do they fit in?"

"I would never sleep with a bi guy," said Elkie.

"That's something I've heard a few times," Chris said, not adding *from Jewish
women*.  "I don't get it."

"They got fucked in the ass," said Elkie.  "That grosses me out, I couldn't date
a man like that.  It's just my preference."

One of the other men at the table raised an eyebrow.

"I mean, all sex is inherently kind of gross," said Chris, and was silent.

After a few more minutes of listening, Chris scooted away from Elkie to talk to
Stephan, a talented .NET developer who had once convinced Chris to experiment
with Mono.  Out of the corner of his eye, Chris watched Elkie talk to a new guy
wearing a summer suit.  She was flirting with him, too.  Probably making more of
an effort, Chris could tell.

If she knew where I worked, thought Chris.  He stewed for a while, realizing
that he was fatigued.  It would be dark outside soon.   

Elkie was talking about her app again, and the guy was eating it up.  The guy
invited Elkie out onto the veranda.

*Stupid*, he thought, as he stood up from the booth, grabbing his unnecessary
Patagonia jacket, and *typical*.  He walked home without giving Elkie another
glance.

Chris worked at Facebook.  He didn't want the summer to end; he didn't want the
interns to go back to school, leaving Chris at Facebook, where he'd stay
indefinitely, beginning the journey of adulthood.  

He was arriving at the office later and later each day, spending the early
afternoon reading his newsfeed until he couldn't stand it anymore.  He was angry
at all of the little bits of content that were stealing his time, his summer.  

"A Woman Jumped to Her Death From a Rooftop Bar, and People Kept Partying,"
Chris read.  One of his coworkers had shared the article, saying something about
the culture of tech.  There was a picture of Elkie.

Chris was confused for a moment: Elkie had added him on Facebook.  Was there an
issue with the development build?  He opened the article in a new tab, and
searched for Elkie's profile.  He switched back to the article, skin crawling.

Elkie was dead, she had jumped off the roof of a building in midtown during a
corporate party.  Suicide.  Fuck.

Chris almost sent the article to one of his friends, but decided against it.
Triggering.

Elkie hadn't seemed that fucked up, thought Chris.  The conversation about the
anti-depressants: that was a pretty typical ice breaker, a symbolic game like
talking about astrological signs or personality types.  

The Nazi thing was pretty fucked up though, thought Chris.  Finish the job.
That was chilling.

Chris noticed that he was sweating: the office was normally frigid, but
sometimes the AC system couldn't keep up with the onset of heat in the early
afternoon.  He terminated his session and went to the microkitchen to get a
smoothie.

He read more about Elkie: it was unclear if she had been 'connected' with the
rooftop event.  She had asked a server to point out the eastern ledge of the
roof, and had sprinted and jumped over the shrubbery.  She had been wearing a
dress and shoes.

Chris looked at her facebook profile: people were posting on her wall, praying
it was a mistake, asking for the contact information of her family.  

Chris went back to his computer, telling himself that it was important to not
use this event as an excuse to have an inefficient bender, or an existential
crisis, rather.  But he was going to look into things.

He ssh'd into the virtual machine that he had used the previous summer as an
intern.  He'd worked on facebook messenger search infrastructure, and during the
course of his work had realized that he could use the message search index to
reconstruct the message history of any facebook user.  He was pretty sure it
didn't leave any auditable log, but if it did, getting fired from facebook would
probably work out well for Chris.  

He ran the script to hydrate Elkie's message index, and opened it in a vim
buffer.  The raw JSON was a pain to read, and Chris paged through a list of
people who had messaged Elkie this morning, after the story had dropped.

<hr>

That evening, Chris met an old friend in front of her apartment in Brooklyn.  He
was buying some Ritalin from her, because he was planning on spending the
weekend at Whole Foods working on an open source project.

"Shit got real fast, I guess," said Chris.

Chris felt like a loser half the time, and he was making $120,000 a year.
