# Summer of Entropy

An one-legged dachshund jumped over Chris's feet, chasing a group of other
sleek, unusual Brooklyn dogs.  The dogs ran circles around the bar's veranda,
amusing the young adults perched on wooden benches and tables, fresh from work.
As Chris turned to watch the dogs, he found himself facing a skinny,
dark-haired woman.

"Hi, are you here for the tech meetup?" Chris asked, catching her eyes.

"Yeah," she said.  It was easy to talk to her, Chris thought.  As it happens
sometimes, in just a few minutes they were talking about psychiatric drugs.  

"I feel a lot more social at these events when I'm on Klonopin," the woman said,
a statement of fact.

"I know what you mean, Lexapro made me like that."

The dogs came around again, and Chris stuck out his hand.  The dachshund stopped
to smell it, and gave it a lick.

"I raised a dog like this when I was on Lexapro," Chris said.  "I was eighteen,
living at home with my parents."

"Oh, I did Lexapro too.  The side effects were weird for me though, so I
switched to Wellbutrin."

"It didn't really have any bad side effects, for me," said Chris.  "If anything
the side effects were good."

"Oh yeah?" she said.  "Like sexual stuff?"

"Yeah."

"What?"

"The sexual stuff?  It, uh, made it harder to have an orgasm, but not in a bad
way.  I would just have like, super orgasms," said Chris.

"Anyways," he continued,  "Lexapro worked out really well for me."

The woman introduced herself as Elkie.  Chris confirmed the spelling with her,
E-L-K-I-E, and went to get another beer. 

When he returned, someone was talking to Elkie about iOS development.  It was
the guy Chris had been talking to earlier. 

"I'll show you my app later," Elkie said.  "I really need feedback on my app."

"Of course."

Elkie turned to Chris, a concerned look in her eyes.

"If I show you my app, you have to promise not to steal the idea.  I've been
working really hard on it." 

Fuck, Chris thought.  Elkie was starting to seem pretty naive, and Chris was
bad at dealing with that.  For fifteen minutes he half-heartedly participated in
an earnest, clumsy discussion of Swift's type system, before finally suggesting
that they go inside for another drink.  On his way back into the sweet,
cave-like darkness of the bar, he knelt to touch the dachshund again.

Chris and Elkie stood at the end of the bar, waiting for the bartender's
attention.  

"The last time I was at this meetup," said Elkie.  "I was with this guy from
Tinder."

"How was he?"

"I was going to swipe left on him, but then I noticed he had like fifteen
thousand twitter followers."  Chris gave her a disapproving look, smiling.

"He was okay, he was Jewish."

"Are you Jewish?" asked Chris.  He looked at her again: obviously she was.  

In college, it had taken Chris a while to realize that the girls who talked to
him at parties were of a type: Jewish, from New York or Long Island, and almost
always wealthy.  Now, in the post-graduate world, he appreciated their prescence
at any social event.

"I grew up in a Hasidic family, but now I'm estranged," said Elkie. 

"Woah, I'm sorry." 

"It's okay, I can eat bacon now.  Are you Jewish?"

"No, not really," said Chris.  "Hasidic?  Like Orthodox?"

"Like Orthodox but a cult, you know, South Williamsburg?  It's awful.  They're
awful, and keep getting worse.  Honestly, I wish the Nazis had finished the
job."

"What do you mean by finished the job," said Chris.

"The Nazis killed almost all of the Hasids, but some of them got away to
Brooklyn."

"Wow, rough.  I'm sorry," said Chris.  His skin felt cold.

They sat down in a booth.  Their legs were touching.

Chris felt confident.  It was summer, he was wearing over $1000 worth of
clothes.   He drew from his own past, finding that it resonated with Elkie.
They both had exes who lived in castle-like apartments on the Upper East Side,
they both liked department stores and meeting lots of people.  

Suddenly there was a burst of light: Elkie's umbrella was on fire.  David
reached over to grab a carafe of water and doused the flames.

"Oh my God," said Elkie, fanning herself. 

"The candle," said David, pointing at the extinguished tealight hydroplaning
slowly over the table.

Some other people from the meetup group came over, attracted by the acrid smell
of burnt plastic.  Elkie repeatedly thanked Chris, who felt satisfied with
himself.

The other programmers sat down with drinks, and their faces hovered in the
darkness.

"Are you going to tell us your app idea?" asked the guy from before, when things
had calmed down.

"What about bi guys?" said someone.  "Where do they fit in?"

"I would never sleep with a bi guy," said Elkie.

"That's something I've heard a few times," Chris said, not adding *from Jewish
women*.  "I don't get it."

If she knew where I worked, thought Chris.  But he would never say that.
*Stupid*, he thought, as he stood up from the booth, grabbing his unnecessary
Patagonia jacket, and *typical*.  He walked out without giving Elkie another
glance, and walked home.

Chris worked at Facebook.

Discovering Elkie's suicide.

Elkie hadn't seemed that fucked up, thought Chris.  Talking about psych drugs
was a pretty typical ice breaker, kind of like talking about astrological signs
or Myers-Briggs personality types.  The only really fucked up thing was the
thing about the Nazis.  That was chilling.

Researching Elkie.

That evening, Chris met an old friend in front of her apartment in Brooklyn.  He
was buying some Ritalin from her, because he was planning on spending the next
weekend at Whole Foods working on an open source project.

"Shit got real fast, I guess," said Chris.
