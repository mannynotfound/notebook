# Summer of Entropy

An one-legged dachshund jumped over David's feet, chasing a group of larger dogs
around the outdoor area behind the bar.  The owners of the dogs were perched
together on one of the wooden benches, laughing.  They looked fresh from work,
holding golden draft beers.  David felt tired and cagey, and was sick of the guy
he was been talking to.  As he turned to watch the dogs, he found himself facing
a skinny, dark-haired woman.

"Cute dogs, hi.  Are you here for the tech meetup?" asked David.  She was.
Conversation started up naturally, and quite soon they were talking about
psychiatric drugs. 

"It's easier to be social at these things when I'm on Klonopin," said the woman.

"Lexapro was like that for me, I think, it helped me be social," said David.  "I
met a lot of people on it."

"The side effects were weird for me, so I switched to Wellbutrin."

The dogs came around again, and David stuck out his hand.  The dachshund stopped
to smell it, and give it one lick.

"I didn't have any bad side effects, really.  If anything the side effects were
good."

"Oh yeah?" she said.  "Like sexual stuff?"

"Yeah," said David.

"What?"

"The sexual stuff?  Um, it made it harder to have an orgasm, but not in a bad
way.  I would just have super orgasms or something," said David, not feeling
particularly embarrassed.

"Anyways," he continued,  "Lexapro worked out really well for me, I don't take
it anymore.  It was just for school, school was hard."

The woman introduced herself as Elkie.  David confirmed the spelling with her,
smiling and saying E-L-K-I-E.  He stood up to get another beer. 

When he got back, a guy that David recognized from earlier meetups joined the
conversation, obviously because it was less boring than the other conversations,
David thought.  Elkie told them that she was iOS developer.  

"I'll show you my app later," she said.  "I really need feedback on my app."

"Of course."

Elkie turned to David, a concerned look in her eyes.

"If I show you my app, you have to promise not to steal the idea.  I've been
working really hard on it."

Fuck, David thought.  For a moment he felt profoundly annoyed with the fact that
he had met another of Elkie's type.  The group started talking about app
development, and David found himself in a conversation about the merit's of
Swift's type system.  To steer the conversation away from programming, he
suggested that they go inside.  On the way into the dark bar, he knelt to touch
the dachshund, which reminded him of home.

David stood at the end of the bar with Elkie, waiting to get the bartender's
attention.  She was telling him about the last time she'd been to this meetup,
with a tech guy she'd met on Tinder.

"I was about to swipe left, but then I noticed he had like fifteen thousand
twitter followers and was in YCombinator."  David gave her a disapproving look
while smiling.

"You should try to buy low and sell high though, right?" said David.  "Anyways,
did you seem him again?"

"No.  Too bad, he was Jewish."

"Are you Jewish?" asked David.  He looked at her again: obviously she was.  In
college, it had taken him a while to realize that the type of girls who talked
to him at parties were of a well-known type: Jewish, from New York or Long
Island, and almost always wealthy.  

"I grew up Hasidic, but I left the faith," said Elkie.  "Are you Jewish?"

"No, not really," said David.  "Hasidic?  Like Orthodox?"

"Like Orthodox but a cult.  It's awful.  They're awful.  They keep getting
worse.  Honestly, I wish the Nazis had finished the job."

"Finished the job?"

"They killed almost all of the Hasid tribes.  Just a few of them escaped and
came here."

"Wow.  I'm sorry,"

If she knew where I worked, thought David.  But he would never say that.
*Stupid*, he thought, as he stood up from the booth, grabbing his unnecessary
Patagonia jacket, and *typical*.  He walked out without giving Elkie another
glance, and walked home.

<hr>



Elkie hadn't seemed that fucked up, thought David.  Talking about psych drugs
was a pretty typical ice breaker, kind of like talking about astrological signs
or Myers-Briggs personality types.  The only really fucked up thing was the
thing about the Nazis.  That was chilling.
