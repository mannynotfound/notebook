# Summer of Entropy

An one-legged dachshund jumped over Chris's feet, chasing a group of other
sleek, unusual dogs with beautiful eyes.  The dogs were running in circles
around the bar's veranda, wriggling between wooden tables and benches full of
young adults.  As Chris turned to watch the dachshund, he caught the eyes of a
skinny, dark-haired woman.

"Hi, are you here for the tech meetup?" Chris asked.

"Yeah," she said.  She seemed happy to talk to Chris, and in just a few minutes,
as it sometimes happens, they were talking about psychiatric drugs.

"I feel a lot more social at these things when I'm on Klonopin," the woman said,
a statement of fact.

The dogs came around again, and Chris stuck out his hand.  The dachshund stopped
to give it a lick.

"I raised a dog like this when I was on Lexapro," Chris said.  "When I was
eighteen, living at home with my parents."

"I did Lexapro once, it had weird side effects."

"Really?  If anything the side effects were good, for me."

"Oh yeah?" she said.  "Like sexual stuff?"

"Yeah."

"What?"

"The sexual stuff?  It, uh, made it harder to have an orgasm, but not in a bad
way.  I would just have like, super orgasms," said Chris.

"Anyways," he continued,  "Lexapro worked out really well for me."

The woman introduced herself as Elkie.  Chris confirmed the spelling with her,
E-L-K-I-E, and went to get another beer. 

When he returned, someone was in his place, talking to Elkie about iOS
development.  Chris had talked to the guy earlier.

"I'll show you my app," Elkie said.  "I really need feedback on my app."

"Of course," the guy said.

Elkie turned to Chris, concern in her eyes.

"If I show you my app, you have to promise not to steal the idea.  I've been
working super hard on it." 

Fuck, thought Chris.  Was Elkie really that naive? 

For fifteen minutes, Chris half-heartedly participated in an earnest, clumsy
discussion of Swift's type system, before finally suggesting that they go inside
for another drink.  Chris knelt down to touch the dachshund again, feeling a
little silly.

The air inside of the bar was sweet and cave-like.  Elkie joined Chris by the
antique cash register, to await the bartender's attention.  

"The last time I was at this meetup," said Elkie, "I was with this guy from
Tinder."

"Oh yeah?"

"I was going to swipe left on him, but I noticed he had like fifteen thousand
twitter followers."  Chris gave her a disapproving look, smiling.

"How was he?"

"He was okay, he was Jewish."

"Are you Jewish?" asked Chris.  He looked at her again: obviously she was.  

It had taken Chris a while in college to realize that the girls who talked to
him at parties were of a certain type: Jewish, from New York or Long Island, and
almost always wealthy.  He still enjoyed talking to them at post-graduate world
social events.

"I grew up in a Hasidic family, but now I'm estranged," said Elkie. 

"Woah, I'm sorry.  Losing your family is really rough." 

"It's okay.  Are you Jewish?"

"No, not really," said Chris.  "Hasidic?  Is that like Orthodox?"

"Like Orthodox, but a cult, you know, South Williamsburg?  They're awful, and
keep getting worse.  Honestly, I wish the Nazis had finished the job."

"What do you mean by finished the job," said Chris.

"Almost all of the Hasids were killed in the Holocaust, but some of them got
away to Brooklyn."

"Wow, Jesus.  I'm sorry," said Chris.  His skin felt cold.

Once they received their mixed drinks, they sat down in a large booth, legs
touching.

Chris felt confident.  It was summer, and he was wearing at least $1000 worth of
clothes.   He directed the conversation by drawing from his own past, finding
that it resonated with Elkie.  They both had exes who lived in castle-like
apartments on the Upper East Side, they both liked department stores, tech
events, and meeting lots of people. 

Suddenly there was a burst of light: Elkie's umbrella was on fire.  David
reached over to grab a carafe of water and doused the flames.

"Oh my God," said Elkie, fanning herself. 

"The candle," said David, pointing at an extinguished tealight hydroplaning
across the table.

The smell of burnt plastic attracted some other people from the meetup, who
joined Chris and Elkie in the booth.  Elkie thanked Chris repeatedly, and Chris
felt satisfied with himself.

"Are you going to tell us your app idea?" asked the guy from earlier, when
things had calmed down.

"Okay, okay, yeah," said Elkie, a little flustered.  She got everyone to agree
that dating apps didn't really work, and told the story of the Tinder guy with
15,000 followers, again.  That hadn't worked out.

But once, her gay friend had set up, Elkie said.  And that had worked out.

"So your idea is an app that lets people set up their friends?" said a guy with
red hair.

"No, it helps gay people set up their straight friends."

The group laughed, and started asking clever questions, all with the implicit
assumption that this app, the actual software of it, would never exist.

"I see an issue," said Chris.  "What's the incentive for the gay matchmakers?
Do they get to see the messages or something?"

Elkie ignored Chris's question, and continued making her case for the app.  The
faces of the other programmers hovered in the darkness.

"What about bi guys?" asked someone.  "Where do they fit in?"

"I would never sleep with a bi guy," said Elkie.

"That's something I've heard a few times," Chris said, not adding *from Jewish
women*.  "I don't get it."

"They get fucked in the ass," said Elkie.  "That grosses me out, I couldn't date
a man like that.  It's just my preference."

The guy with red hair raised an eyebrow.

After a few minutes of continued discussion of Elkie's app, Chris scooted over
to Stephan, a talented .NET developer who had convinced Chris to experiment with
the Mono framework.  As Chris talked with Stephan, he watched Elkie out of the
corner of his eye.  She was talking to a new guy, a guy wearing a summer suit.
She was flirting with him, too.  Probably making more of an effort, Chris could
tell.

If she knew where I worked, thought Chris.  He stewed for a while, suddenly
feeling tired.  It would be dark outside soon.   

Elkie was talking about her app again, and the guy was eating it up.  He invited
her out to the veranda.

*Stupid*, Chris thought, as he stood up from the booth, grabbing his unnecessary
Patagonia jacket, and *typical*.  He said goodbye to Stephan, and walked home
without looking for Elkie.

<hr>

Chris worked at Facebook.  He didn't want the summer to end; he didn't want the
interns to go back to school, leaving Chris at Facebook, where he'd stay
indefinitely.  

He was arriving at the office later and later each day, spending the morning
reading his newsfeed until he couldn't stand it anymore.  He was mad at all the
little bits of content stealing his time, his summer.

"A Woman Jumped to Her Death From a Rooftop Bar, and People Kept Partying,"
Chris read.  One of his coworkers had shared the article, saying something about
tech culture.  There was a picture of Elkie.

Chris was confused for a moment: he remembered Elkie adding him as a friend on
Facebook.  Was there an issue with the development build?  He opened the article
in a new tab, and searched for Elkie's profile.  He switched back to the
article, skin crawling.  More pictures of Elkie.

Elkie had jumped off the roof of a building during a corporate party.  Suicide.
She was dead.  Fuck.

Chris almost sent the article to a close friend, but decided against it.
Triggering.

Chris noticed that he was sweating.  The Facebook office was normally frigid,
but sometimes the AC system couldn't keep up with the early afternoon heat.

Chris checked himself.  It was important to *not* use this event as an excuse
for a stupid existential crisis, he told himself.  He terminated his session and
went to the microkitchen for a smoothie.  

He read more about Elkie on his phone: it was unclear if she had been
'connected' with the rooftop event.  She had asked a bartender to point out the
eastern ledge of the roof.  She was wearing a dress and shoes.

Chris looked at Elkie's facebook profile.  People were posting on her wall, praying
it was a mistake, asking for the contact information of her family.  

Chris went back to his computer.  Its fan was whirring at max RPMs, angering
Chris.

He ssh'd into a virtual machine, a machine left over from the previous summer,
when he'd interned on the messenger infrastructure team.  In the course of that
summer, Chris had figured out how to use the search index to reconstruct the
chat history of any user, at will.  He was pretty sure it didn't leave any sort
of audit log.  Even if it did, getting fired from facebook would probably work
out okay for Chris.  

He ran the script to hydrate Elkie's message index, and opened it in a buffer.

A lot of people had frantically or emotionally messaged Elkie that morning,
after the story had dropped.  Chris paged through the index.

He slowed down to read messages from earlier that month: Elkie messaging a tech
guy saying "I don't really know you, but is it okay if we talk?  Feeling low,"
at two AM.  No response.  Someone else responded to a similar message, saying
that he was in Italy for a conference.  Elkie told him about her problems
finding a new apartment.  She'd mentioned that to Chris.

Elkie hadn't seemed *that* fucked up, thought Chris.  The conversation about the
anti-depressants: that was a pretty typical thing to talk about, like talking
about astrological signs or personality types.  The Nazi thing though, thought
Chris.  Finish the job.

He spent about an hour reading through Elkie's chat logs, reconstructing the
absence that he had expected.  There weren't any obvious red flags, just nothing
interesting, nothing hopeful.

Because the day was already fucked, Chris opened a new buffer and grepped
through the recent messages of his ex, looking for variations of his own name.   

<hr>

That evening, Chris met an old friend in front of her apartment in Bushwick.  He
was buying some Ritalin from her, to use that weekend at Whole Foods.  Things
felt unusually surreal, even for East Williamsburg.

"How are you?" Justine asked, after placing the small pills in Chris's hand.

"Uh, kind of weird," said Chris.

"Why, what's up?"

Justine sat down on her stoop, and looked at Chris quizzically.  Justine could
deal with the Elkie thing, thought Chris.  She was a tough senior in art school,
and probably had heard a lot of fucked up things.  "Someone I know killed
themselves by jumping off a roof," said Chris, still standing.

"At a fancy party?  I think I saw this," said Justine.  Chris had noticed that
the papers in the bodega were going with the Hasidic angle, not the tech angle.  

"Yeah, you probably did.  I met her at a programming thing."

"That's messed up.  You okay?"  

"Yeah.  I didn't know her that well, it's just disorienting." 

Chris felt a stab of affection for his well-dressed friend, who had once told
him that they  would one day rekindle their romantic relationship in a different
city, maybe Hong Kong, when they were older.

"I know.  How old was she?"

"Thirty, I think." 

"Oh.  Not married, right?  It seems like women start having problems at that
age, like serious mental health problems."

Chris made a face.  

"I really hope that's not how it works," he said.  "That's so bleak."

"Yeah, but the whole 'body-positivity-everyone-is-beautiful' thing is such
bullshit," said Justine without affect.  

Chris didn't say anything.  Someone in middle school had once told him that he
was really handsome until he opened his mouth.

"I know I'm not beautiful, I look at Korean Instagram models.  I accept my body,
I don't love it.  I'm not deluded."  

Chris felt surprised that Justine was saying these things.

"I mean, isn't beauty a pretty arbitrary thing?" he said.  

"Well, yes.  But so what?  That doesn't change how it affects *your* life."


Chris was starting to feel really weird.  He looked at Justine in a new,
unpleasantly objective light, recognizing in her something he was starting to
see in a lot of his peers: a rapid onset of entropy, a cascade of shit getting
real, an unravelling of the fantasy world of youth.   Chris felt like a loser
half the time, and he was making $120,000 a year.  He had imagined so much more.
How did Elkie feel?  Her app development 'company': brutal.  She had so much to
learn, so much complexity to master before she could even start making valuable
things.  

"I don't know that I agree with you," Chris said.  "I would rather people be happy.
It's all in our heads anyways."

"I'm a computer person, I always think that things can be fixed," he said. 

Justine laughed.  "Good fucking luck," she said. 

After they finished talking, Chris decided to walk home.  It was dark and he was
sweating.  

Chris stopped at the bar where he had met Elkie.  Of course it was on the way
home.  He drank two draft beers, thinking.

As waited to close out his tab, a woman who looked kind of like Kristen Dunst
said 'hi' and asked Chris how he was doing.
