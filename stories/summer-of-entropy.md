# Summer of Entropy

An one-legged dachshund jumped over Chris's feet, chasing a group of other
sleek, unusual dogs with beautiful eyes.  The dogs were running in circles
around the bar's veranda, wriggling between wooden tables and benches full of
young adults.  As Chris turned to watch the dachshund, he found himself facing a
skinny, dark-haired woman.

"Hi, are you here for the tech meetup?" Chris asked, catching her eyes.

"Yeah," she said.  She seemed happy to talk to Chris, and in just a few minutes,
as it sometimes happens, they were talking about psychiatric drugs.

"I feel a lot more social at these things when I'm on Klonopin," the woman said,
a statement of fact.

"I know what you mean, Lexapro made me like that."

The dogs came around again, and Chris stuck out his hand.  The dachshund stopped
to give it a lick.

"I raised a dog like this when I was on Lexapro," Chris said.  "When I was
eighteen, living at home with my parents."

"I was on Lexapro, it had weird side effects."

"Really?  If anything the side effects were good, for me."

"Oh yeah?" she said.  "Like sexual stuff?"

"Yeah."

"What?"

"The sexual stuff?  It, uh, made it harder to have an orgasm, but not in a bad
way.  I would just have like, super orgasms," said Chris.

"Anyways," he continued,  "Lexapro worked out really well for me."

The woman introduced herself as Elkie.  Chris confirmed the spelling with her,
E-L-K-I-E, and went to get another beer. 

When he returned, someone was in his place, talking to Elkie about iOS
development.  Chris had talked to the guy earlier.

"I'll show you my app later," Elkie said.  "I really need feedback on my app."

"Of course," the guy said.

Elkie turned to Chris, concerned.

"If I show you my app, you have to promise not to steal the idea.  I've been
working super hard on it." 

Fuck, thought Chris.  Was Elkie that naive?  Chris half-heartedly participated
in an earnest, clumsy discussion of Swift's type system for fifteen minutes,
before finally suggesting that they go inside for another drink.  On his way
into the cave-like bar, Chris knelt down to touch the dachshund.

Elkie joined Chris by the antique cash register, to wait for the bartender's
attention.  

"The last time I was at this meetup," said Elkie.  "I was with this guy from
Tinder."

"Oh yeah?"

"I was going to swipe left on him, but then I noticed he had like fifteen
thousand twitter followers."  Chris gave her a disapproving look, smiling.

"How was he?"

"He was okay, he was Jewish."

"Are you Jewish?" asked Chris.  He looked at her again: obviously she was.  

In college, it had taken Chris a while to realize that the girls who talked to
him at parties were of a certain type: Jewish, from New York or Long Island, and
almost always wealthy.  Now, in the post-graduate world, he still appreciated
their presence in social situations.

"I grew up in a Hasidic family, but now I'm estranged," said Elkie. 

"Woah, I'm sorry." 

"It's okay.  Are you Jewish?"

"No, not really," said Chris.  "Hasidic?  Is that like Orthodox?"

"Like Orthodox, but a cult, you know, South Williamsburg?  They're awful, and
keep getting worse.  Honestly, I wish the Nazis had finished the job."

"What do you mean by finished the job," said Chris.

"Almost all of the Hasids were killed in the Holocaust, but some of them got
away to Brooklyn."

"Wow, Jesus.  I'm sorry," said Chris.  His skin felt cold.

Once they received their mixed drinks, they sat down in a large booth, legs
touching.

Chris felt confident.  It was summer, and he was wearing at least $1000 worth of
clothes.   He drew from his own past for conversation, finding that it resonated
with Elkie.  They both had exes who lived in castle-like apartments on the Upper
East Side, they both liked department stores, events, and meeting lots of
people. 

Suddenly there was a burst of light: Elkie's umbrella was on fire.  David
reached over to grab a carafe of water and doused the flames.

"Oh my God," said Elkie, fanning herself. 

"The candle," said David, pointing at an extinguished tealight hydroplaning
across the table.

The smell of burnt plastic attracted some other people from the meetup, who
joined Chris and Elkie in the booth.  Elkie was repeatedly thanking Chris, who
felt satisfied with himself.

"Are you going to tell us your app idea?" asked the guy from outside, when
things had calmed down.

"Okay, okay, yeah," said Elkie, a little flustered.  She got everyone to agree
that dating apps didn't really work, and told the story of the Tinder guy with
15,000 followers, again.  That hadn't worked out.

But her gay friend had set up once, she said.  And that had worked.

"So your idea is an app that lets people set up their friends?" said a guy with
red hair.

"No, it helps gay people set up their straight friends."

The group laughed, and started asking clever questions, all with the implicit
assumption that this app, the actual software of it, would never exist.

"I see an issue," said Chris.  "What's the incentive for the gay matchmakers?
Do they get to see the messages or something?"

Elkie ignored Chris's question, and continued making her case for the app.  The
faces of the other programmers hovered in the darkness.

"What about bi guys?" asked someone.  "Where do they fit in?"

"I would never sleep with a bi guy," said Elkie.

"That's something I've heard a few times," Chris said, not adding *from Jewish
women*.  "I don't get it."

"They get fucked in the ass," said Elkie.  "That grosses me out, I couldn't date
a man like that.  It's just my preference."

The guy with the red hair raised an eyebrow.

After a few minutes, Chris scooted over to Stephan, a talented .NET developer
who had convinced Chris to experiment with Mono.  As he talked with Stephan, he
watched Elkie out of the corner of his eye.  She was talking to a new guy, a guy
wearing a summer suit.  She was flirting with him, too.  Probably making more of
an effort, Chris could tell.

If she knew where I worked, thought Chris.  He stewed for a while, suddenly
feeling tired.  It would be dark outside soon.   

Elkie was talking about her app again, and the guy was eating it up.  He invited
her outside.

*Stupid*, Chris thought, as he stood up from the booth, grabbing his unnecessary
Patagonia jacket, and *typical*.  He said goodbye to Stephan, and then walked
home without giving Elkie another glance.

<hr>

Chris worked at Facebook.  He didn't want the summer to end; he didn't want the
interns to go back to school, leaving Chris at Facebook, where he'd stay
indefinitely.  

He was arriving at the office later and later each day, spending the morning
reading his newsfeed until he couldn't stand it anymore.  

"A Woman Jumped to Her Death From a Rooftop Bar, and People Kept Partying,"
Chris read.  One of his coworkers had shared the article, saying something about
tech culture.  There was a picture of Elkie.

Chris was confused for a moment: he remembered Elkie adding him as a friend on
Facebook.  Was there an issue with the development build?  He opened the article
in a new tab, and searched for Elkie's profile.  He switched back to the
article, skin crawling.  There were more pictures of Elkie.

Elkie had jumped off the roof of a building in midtown during a corporate party.
Suicide.  She was dead.  Fuck.

Chris almost sent the article to a close friend, but decided against it.
Triggering.

Chris noticed that he was sweating.  The facebook office was normally frigid,
but sometimes the AC system couldn't keep up with the heat in the early
afternoon.

It was important *not* to use this event as an excuse for a stupid existential
crisis, Chris told himself.  He terminated his session and went to the
microkitchen to get a smoothie.  

On his phone, he read more about Elkie: it was unclear if she had been
'connected' with the rooftop event.  She had asked a bartender to point out the
eastern ledge of the roof.  She was wearing a dress and shoes.

Chris looked at her facebook profile.  People were posting on her wall, praying
it was a mistake, asking for the contact information of her family.  

Chris went back to his computer. 

He ssh'd into a virtual machine, a machine left over from the previous summer,
when he'd interned on the messenger search infrastructure team.  In the course
of that work, Chris had figured out how to use the search index to reconstruct
the chat history of any user, at will.  He was pretty sure it didn't leave any
sort of audit log.  Even if it did, getting fired from facebook would work out
pretty well for Chris.  

He ran the script to hydrate Elkie's message index, and opened it in a buffer.

A lot of people had messaged Elkie that morning, after the story had dropped.
Some of it was frantic.  Chris paged through the index.

Chris slowed down to read messages from earlier that month: Elkie messaging a
grizzled tech guy saying "I don't really know you, but is it okay if we talk?
Feeling low," at two AM.  No response.  Someone else responded to a similar
message, saying that he was in Italy for a conference.  Elkie told him about her
problems finding a new apartment.  She'd mentioned that to Chris.

Elkie hadn't seemed *that* fucked up, thought Chris.  The conversation about the
anti-depressants: that was a pretty typical thing to talk about, an icebreaker
like talking about astrological signs or personality types.  The Nazi thing
though, thought Chris.  Finish the job.

Because the day was already fucked, Chris grepped through the recent messages of
his ex and friends, looking for variations of his own name and actionable
insights.   

<hr>

That evening, Chris met an old friend in front of her apartment in Bushwick.  He
was buying some Ritalin from her, to use that weekend at Whole Foods, where he
was planning to work on an open source project.  Things felt unusually surreal,
even for East Williamsburg.

"How are you?" Justine asked, after placing the small pills in Chris's hand.

"Uh, kind of weird," said Chris.

"Why, what's up?"

Justine sat down on her stoop, and looked at Chris quizzically.  Justine could
deal with this, thought Chris.  She was a senior in art school and probably
dealt with a lot of fucked up things.  "Someone I know killed themselves by
jumping off a roof," said Chris, still standing.

"At a fancy party?  I think I saw this," said Justine.  Elkie's face was on the
cover of papers in the bodegas; Chris had noticed that they were going with the
Hasidic angle, not the tech angle.

"Yeah, you probably did.  I met her at a programming thing."

"That's messed up, are you okay?"  Chris felt a stab of affection for his
well-dressed friend, who had once told him that she looked forward to one day
rekindling their relationship in a different city, maybe Hong Kong, when they
were older.

"Yeah.  I didn't know her that well, it's just disorienting." 

"I know.  How old was she?"

"Thirty, I think." 

"Oh.  Not married, right?  I think a lot of women start having problems at that
age, like serious mental health problems."

Chris made a face.  

"I really hope that's not how it works," he said.  "That's too bleak."

"The whole body positivity 'everyone is beautiful' thing is delusional
bullshit," said Justine without affect.  "I know I'm not beautiful, looking at
Korean Instagram models makes that obvious.  I accept my body, I don't love it."  

Chris was taken a bit by surprise.

"I mean, isn't beauty a pretty arbitrary thing?" he said.  




Chris had recognized in Elkie something he was starting to see in his peers: a
rapid onset of entropy, a cascade of shit getting real, an unravelling of the
fantasy world of youth.   Chris felt like a loser half the time, and he was
making $120,000 a year.  He had imagined so much more.  How did Elkie feel?  Her
app development 'company': brutal.  She had so much to learn, so much complexity
to master before she could even start making valuable things.  

Someone in middle school had once told him that he was really handsome until he
opened his mouth.


After they finished talking, Chris started walking home.  The bar he'd met Elkie
at was on the way, and Chris went in and sat at the bar.  He drank two draft
beers, thinking.

As waited to close out his tab, a woman who looked kind of like Kristen Dunst
said hi and asked Chris how he was doing.
