# Summer of Entropy

An one-legged dachshund jumped over David's feet, chasing a group of other dogs.
David turned to watch the dogs weave circles under the wooden benches in the
outdoor space behind the Left Hand Path bar.   The owners of the dogs were
sitting in a group, all of them looking fresh from work.  David's group looked a
lot less fresh, and David was looking for someone new to talk to.

David turned to his right, and said hi to the woman sitting there.  Description of
the woman.

"Hi, are you here for the tech meetup?" said David.  She was, the only other
woman at that month's meetup besides the organizer.  Five minutes later, they
were talking about psychiatric drugs.
