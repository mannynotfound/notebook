# Summer of Entropy

An one-legged dachshund jumped over Chris's feet, chasing a group of sleek,
unusual dogs with beautiful eyes.  The dogs were running in circles around the
bar's veranda, squeezing between wooden benches and tables, their wriggling
amusing groups of young adults perched above.   As Chris turned to watch the
dachshund, he found himself facing a skinny, dark-haired woman.

"Hi, are you here for the tech meetup?" Chris asked, catching her eyes.

"Yeah," she said.  She seemed happy to talk to Chris, and in just a few minutes,
as it sometimes happens, they were talking about psychiatric drugs.

"I feel a lot more social at these things when I'm on Klonopin," the woman said,
a statement of fact.

"I know what you mean, Lexapro made me like that."

The dogs came around again, and Chris stuck out his hand.  The dachshund stopped
to smell it, giving it a lick.

"I raised a dog like this when I was on Lexapro," Chris said.  "When I was
eighteen, living at home with my parents."

"I was on Lexapro, it had weird side effects."

"Really?  If anything the side effects were good, for me."

"Oh yeah?" she said.  "Like sexual stuff?"

"Yeah."

"What?"

"The sexual stuff?  It, uh, made it harder to have an orgasm, but not in a bad
way.  I would just have like, super orgasms," said Chris.

"Anyways," he continued,  "Lexapro worked out really well for me."

The woman introduced herself as Elkie.  Chris confirmed the spelling with her,
E-L-K-I-E, and went to get another beer. 

When he returned, someone was in his place, talking to Elkie about iOS
development.  Chris had talked to the guy earlier.

"I'll show you my app later," Elkie said.  "I really need feedback on my app."

"Of course," the guy said.

Elkie turned to Chris, a concerned look in her eyes.

"If I show you my app, you have to promise not to steal the idea.  I've been
working super hard on it." 

Fuck, Chris thought.  Was Elkie that naive?  Chris half-heartedly participated
in an earnest, clumsy discussion of Swift's type system for fifteen minutes,
before finally suggesting that they go inside for another drink.  On his way
into the sweet cave-like darkness of the bar, Chris knelt down to touch the
dachshund.

Elkie joined Chris by the antique cash register, and they waited for the
bartender's attention.  

"The last time I was at this meetup," said Elkie.  "I was with this guy from
Tinder."

"Oh yeah?"

"I was going to swipe left on him, but then I noticed he had like fifteen
thousand twitter followers."  Chris gave her a disapproving look, smiling.

"How was he?"

"He was okay, he was Jewish."

"Are you Jewish?" asked Chris.  He looked at her again: obviously she was.  

In college, it had taken Chris a while to realize that the girls who talked to
him at parties were of a certain type: Jewish, from New York or Long Island, and
almost always wealthy.  Now, in the post-graduate world, he still appreciated
their presence at any social event.

"I grew up in a Hasidic family, but now I'm estranged," said Elkie. 

"Woah, I'm sorry." 

"It's okay.  Are you Jewish?"

"No, not really," said Chris.  "Hasidic?  Is that like Orthodox?"

"Like Orthodox, but a cult, you know, South Williamsburg?  They're awful, and
keep getting worse.  Honestly, I wish the Nazis had finished the job."

"What do you mean by finished the job," said Chris.

"Almost all of the Hasids were killed in the Holocaust, but some of them got
away to Brooklyn."

"Wow, Jesus.  I'm sorry," said Chris.  His skin felt cold.

They sat down in a large booth with mixed drinks, their legs touching.

Chris felt confident, as they started talking about other things.  It was
summer, and he was wearing at least $1000 worth of clothes.   He drew from his
own past, finding that it resonated with Elkie.  They both had exes who lived in
castle-like apartments on the Upper East Side, they both liked department
stores, events, and meeting lots of people. 

Suddenly there was a burst of light: Elkie's umbrella was on fire.  David
reached over to grab a carafe of water and doused the flames.

"Oh my God," said Elkie, fanning herself. 

"The candle," said David, pointing at an extinguished tealight hydroplaning
slowly across the table.

The smell of burnt plastic attracted some other people from the meetup, who
joined Elkie and Chris in the booth.  Elkie was repeatedly thanking Chris, who
felt satisfied with himself.

"Are you going to tell us your app idea?" asked the guy from before, when things
had calmed down.

"Okay, okay, yeah," said Elkie, a little flustered.  She got everyone to agree
that dating apps didn't really work, and told the story of the Tinder guy with
15,000 followers again.   But her gay friend had set up once, she said, and it
had worked.

"So your idea is an app that lets people set up their friends?"

"No, it helps gay people set up their straight friends."

The group laughed, and started asking clever questions, all with the implicit
assumption that this app, the actual software of it, would never exist.

"I see an issue," said Chris.  "What's the incentive for the gay matchmakers?
Do they get to see the messages or something?"

Elkie ignored Chris's question, and continued making the case for the app.  The
faces of the other programmers hovered in the darkness.

"What about bi guys?" said someone.  "Where do they fit in?"

"I would never sleep with a bi guy," said Elkie.

"That's something I've heard a few times," Chris said, not adding *from Jewish
women*.  "I don't get it."

"They get fucked in the ass," said Elkie.  "That grosses me out, I couldn't date
a man like that.  It's just my preference."

One of the other men at the table raised an eyebrow.

"I mean, all sex is inherently kind of gross," said Chris, and was silent.

After a few minutes, Chris scooted away from Elkie to talk to Stephan, a
talented .NET developer who had convinced Chris to experiment with Mono.  Out of
the corner of his eye, Chris watched Elkie.  She was talking to a new guy, a guy
wearing a summer suit.  She was flirting with him, too.  Probably making more of
an effort, Chris could tell.

If she knew where I worked, thought Chris.  He stewed for a while, realizing
that he was fatigued.  It would be dark outside soon.   

Elkie was talking about her app again, and the guy was eating it up.  The guy
invited Elkie out onto the veranda.

*Stupid*, he thought, as he stood up from the booth, grabbing his unnecessary
Patagonia jacket, and *typical*.  He walked home without giving Elkie another
glance.

<hr>

Chris worked at Facebook.  He didn't want the summer to end; he didn't want the
interns to go back to school, leaving Chris at Facebook, where he'd stay
indefinitely.  

He was arriving at the office later and later each day, spending the early
afternoon reading his newsfeed until he couldn't stand it anymore.  He was angry
at all of the little bits of content that were stealing his time, his summer.  

"A Woman Jumped to Her Death From a Rooftop Bar, and People Kept Partying,"
Chris read.  One of his coworkers had shared the article, saying something about
tech culture and mental health.  There was a picture of Elkie.

Chris was confused for a moment: Elkie had added him on Facebook.  Was there an
issue with the development build?  He opened the article in a new tab, and
searched for Elkie's profile.  He switched back to read the article, skin
crawling.  There were more pictures of Elkie.

Elkie had jumped off the roof of a building in midtown during a corporate party.
Suicide.  She was dead.  Fuck.

Chris went to send the article to a close friend, but decided against it.
Triggering.

Elkie hadn't seemed that fucked up, thought Chris.  The conversation about the
anti-depressants, that was a pretty typical icebreaker, like talking about
astrological signs or personality types.  

The Nazi thing was pretty fucked up though, thought Chris.  Finish the job.
That was chilling.

Chris noticed that he was sweating.  The facebook office was normally frigid,
but sometimes the AC system couldn't keep up with the early afternoon heat.
Chris told himself that it was important to not use this event as an excuse to
have an inefficient bender, or an existential crisis, rather.  He terminated his
session and went to the microkitchen to get a smoothie.  

He read more about Elkie: it was unclear if she had been 'connected' with the
rooftop event.  She had asked a server to point out the eastern ledge of the
roof.  She had been wearing a dress and shoes.

Chris looked at her facebook profile on his phone: people were posting on her
wall, praying it was a mistake, asking for the contact information of her
family.  

Chris went back to his computer.  He was going to look into things.

He ssh'd into a virtual machine, a machine that was left over from the previous
summer, when he was in intern on the messenger search infrastructure team.
During the course of his work, Chris had realized that he could use the message
search index to reconstruct the message history of any facebook user.  He was
pretty sure it didn't leave any audit log.   Even if it did, getting fired from
facebook would probably work out pretty well for Chris.  

He ran the script to hydrate Elkie's message index, and opened it in a vim
buffer. Chris paged through a list of people who had messaged Elkie this
morning, after the story had dropped.

<hr>

That evening, Chris met an old friend in front of her apartment in Brooklyn.  He
was buying some Ritalin from her, because he was planning on spending the
weekend at Whole Foods working on an open source project.

"Shit got real fast, I guess," said Chris.

Chris felt like a loser half the time, and he was making $120,000 a year.
