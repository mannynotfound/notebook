# Summer of Entropy

An one-legged dachshund jumped over David's feet, chasing a group of larger dogs
around the outdoor area behind the bar.  The owners of the dogs were perched
together on one of the complex wooden benches, fresh from work.  David was sick
of the guy he was talking to.  As he turned to watch the dogs, he found himself
facing a skinny, dark-haired woman.

"Cute dogs, hi.  Are you here for the tech meetup?" asked David. 

"Yeah," she said.  

Conversation started up naturally, and quite soon they were talking about
psychiatric drugs. 

"It's easier to be social at these things when I'm on Klonopin," she said.

"Lexapro was like that for me, I think, it helped me be social," said David.  "I
met a lot of people on it."

The dogs came around again, and David stuck out his hand.  The dachshund stopped
to smell it, and give it a lick.

"I raised a dog like this when I was on Lexapro," David said.  "I was eighteen,
living at home with my parents in Cleveland."

"The side effects were weird for me, so I switched to Wellbutrin."

"I didn't have any bad side effects, really," said David.  "If anything the side
effects were good."

"Oh yeah?" she said.  "Like sexual stuff?"

"Yeah."

"What?"

"The sexual stuff?  It, uh, made it harder to have an orgasm, but not in a bad
way.  I would just have like, super orgasms," said David.

"Anyways," he continued,  "Lexapro worked out really well for me."

The woman introduced herself as Elkie.  David confirmed the spelling with her,
E-L-K-I-E, and went to get another beer. 

When he returned, another guy was talking to Elkie about iOS development.  It
was the guy David had been talking to earlier. 

"I'll show you my app later," Elkie said.  "I really need feedback on my app."

"Of course."

Elkie turned to David, a concerned look in her eyes.

"If I show you my app, you have to promise not to steal the idea.  I've been
working really hard on it." 

Fuck, David thought.  For fifteen minutes he half-heartedly participated in an
earnest, clumsy discussion of Swift's type system.   He finally suggested that
they go inside for another drink.  On the way into the sweet, cave-like darkness
of the bar, he knelt to touch the dachshund again.

David stood at the end of the bar with Elkie, waiting for the bartender's
attention.  

"The last time I was at this meetup," said Elkie.  "I was with this guy from
Tinder."

"How was he?"

"Well, I was going to swipe left on him, but then I noticed he had like fifteen
thousand twitter followers."  David gave her a disapproving look, smiling.

"Have you seen him again?"

"No.  He was Jewish."

"Are you Jewish?" asked David.  He looked at her again: obviously she was.  It
had taken David a while to realize that the girls who talked to him at parties
in college were of a type: Jewish, from New York or Long Island, and almost
always wealthy.  He appreciated their prescence at any social event.

"I grew up in a Hasidic family, but now I'm estranged," said Elkie. "I even eat
bacon.  Are you Jewish?"

"No, not really," said David.  "Hasidic?  Like Orthodox?"

"Like Orthodox but a cult.  Like in South Williamsburg?  It's awful.  They're
awful, and keep getting worse.  Honestly, I wish the Nazis had finished the
job."

"Finished the job?"

"The Nazis killed almost all of the Hasids, but some of them got away to
Brooklyn."

"Wow, rough.  I'm sorry," said David.  His skin felt cold.

They sat down in a booth.  Their legs were touching.

David felt confident.  He talked with Elkie about things he knew she would like.
They both had exes who lived in castle-like apartments on the Upper East Side,
they both liked department stores and meeting lots of people.  He was wearing
over $1000 of clothes, pieces that he'd purchased with his starting bonus, and
could tell that Elkie noticed.

David suddenly noticed a burst of flame.  Elkie's umbrella had caught the flame
of one of the bar's tealights.  He pushed a confused Elkie out of the way,
grabbing a carafe of water, and doused the flames.  



The other people from

They talked about the families of exes who live in castle-like apartments on the
Upper East Side, many old furniture and people in a part of New York that defied
Williamsburgization.  JAP conversation topics.  (paragraph).

Umbrella bursts into flames.

The faces of the other programmers hovered in the darkness.

"What about bi guys?" said someone.  "Where do they fit in?"

"I would never sleep with a bi guy," said Elkie.

"That's something I've heard a few times," I said, not adding *from Jewish
women*.  "I don't get it."

If she knew where I worked, thought David.  But he would never say that.
*Stupid*, he thought, as he stood up from the booth, grabbing his unnecessary
Patagonia jacket, and *typical*.  He walked out without giving Elkie another
glance, and walked home.

David worked at Facebook.

Discovering Elkie's suicide.

Elkie hadn't seemed that fucked up, thought David.  Talking about psych drugs
was a pretty typical ice breaker, kind of like talking about astrological signs
or Myers-Briggs personality types.  The only really fucked up thing was the
thing about the Nazis.  That was chilling.

Researching Elkie.

That evening, David met an old friend in front of her apartment in Brooklyn.  He
was buying some Ritalin from her, because he was planning on spending the next
weekend at Whole Foods working on an open source project.

"Shit got real fast, I guess," said David.
