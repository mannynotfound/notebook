Cornell


AUGUST 2010-->NOVEMBER 2010: 

The day my parents drove me to college, I was wearing a red polo shirt.  
Carrying things up to my dorm room, I saw a pretty Indian girl waiting in the
sun and felt a stab of anxiety.  I wanted to know what college would bring;
whether or not I'd realize my dreams over the next four years.

After walking around campus with my family to get my ID card and
some books, I went to a dining hall with my dad.  He wanted to talk.

The sun was already setting and the dining hall was filled with fall evening 
red and orange colors.  There were many other new students and their parents talking
loudly.  My dad happily got chocolate milk from the stainless steel "milk
udder" and we sat down and ate.

When I awoke I could tell it was another summer-like day.  I stayed in bed
for a while, feeling good.  I thought about the night before.  It seemed like a
good start, even though I didn't meet someone.

After spending some time on my the internet I went to the dining hall and started to
work on the Freshman essay assignment/contest.  The book was "Do Androids Dream 
of Electric Sheep?".  I felt sort of like Harrison Ford, that someday I would
be like one of his characters, if I was right about the potential in me.

I ate pancakes and took notes.  I was alone but happy to be alone
imagining that someone would sit down next to me. 

I spent the rest of the day looking at my new course books and wandering around
campus, trying to find interesting places.  I wanted to find a good place to
study.  I went through the picturesque library overlooking the slope, that
people, maybe the Cornell admissions marketing department, called "The Harry
Potter Library".  This library was nice but did not fit my ideal of an isolated
place for me to study, a place that was mine and would force me to focus and do
college studies right.  I then explored Olin library, which had been the
graduate library at some point, and then Kroch library, the Asian studies
library.  Kroch library was the newest, and the reading rooms felt like a
pediatrician's office.  The stacks were bare long rooms that felt more
industrial than literary.  I found an area that was filled with cubicles meant
for grad students, but most were empty.  There wasn't cell phone service down
there.  This place was good.  

I took out my yellow legal pad and continued to work on ideas for the essay.  I
was worried I wouldn't be able to finish it.  During the last marking period of
high school, I had developed a bad case of "writer's block" and my grade in AP
English Language had gone from a 100 to a 65, due to my inability to turn in
assignments.  Trying to write had also involved a lot of mild to moderate
mania, self-distraction, etc.  But those difficultites had happenened over a
year before, before I had gone to Taiwan.  I thought I had matured a lot living
in Taiwan, and that I would be able to be a good student and do school well.
It was my main preoccupation.



I took notes on Joyce in the library until I was sick of it, and then I went to read outside the marble Goldwin-Smith Hall.  It
was twilight and there were a lot of students on the quad for the
orientation week concert.  It was a dj called...mario something.  I tried
focusing on reading until the music started and then I started milling around
looking at people.  Reading had been pretty good.  I had learned about ... a
saint who died due to indigestion.  I felt the knowledge might be necessary,
like calculus, collegiate.  Two girls stopped me, a
somewhat attractive white girl with short hair and a chubby Asian, probably
Korean.  "Can you take us to the bathroom?" the Asian girl said.  "We really
need your help." They seemed drunk or weird.  "Oh, yeah...I think I know where
there is one.  Follow me." They laughed and followed me through the crowd.
They told me their names and said they went to Ithaca College.  They asked what
I was reading.  I led them accross the quad into the fine arts library.  
I felt on guard.  I liked the white girl, she
looked a little like a skunk because she had dyed hair.  She seemed to think
her friend was funny.  "You like them nerdy" said the skunk girl to the chubby
Asian girl, so I could barely hair, laughing as the Asian girl went into the
bathroom.  I felt good about this.  I felt dazed and calm from reading much of
the day and smiled at the girls.

I followed them back out into the crowd.  The opening group was playing.  Skunk
girl had a water bottle of vodka.  I wanted skunk girl to like me.  Asian girl
was trying to get me to dance.  At once they seemed to be both very interested
in me and completely detached.  Asian girl was grinding against my dick.  She
yelled something in my ear.

"What?"

"Do you want to fuck me?" she asked.

I shook my head and said no, smiling.

"Then why are you _hard_?" she said, seeming frustrated.

"Like a G6"

Mommy drove Chantal, Ian and I back to Buffalo.  She was in a good mood and took
us all to eat at Moosewood, and after eating we walked around the Brentwood
Mall, which isn't a mall in the suburban sense.  It smelled perfectly like Fall
and Ithaca, an almost hazy, smoky smell of upstate New York, my grandparent's
house, water in basements.  I went to the used and rare bookstore and bought a
beautiful version of "The Aeneid", with a handwritten poem in the inside cover,
about the importance of the poem to a young student.  I excitedly showed the
book to my mother.  It had only cost eleven dollars.

I could feel the stress of the past months pushing into me as we began the
drive.  Mommy asked Chantal and Ian about their academics.  I wanted her to stop
talking to Ian about his physics major.  I felt that he'd definitely flake out
of it soon enough.  The way Ian talked about his physics major, it seemed very
obvious that he wanted to impress people with it.  My plan would work out better
in the long run.

By the time we were driving through the amber fields overlooking Cayuga Lake
Mommy had stopped talking to Ian and Chantal, who were dozing (full) in the
backseat, and had started asking me about how things were going.

"Bad."


I felt a chill laying in bed.  I brought my laptop into bed with me to watch tv
shows that I had downloaded.  Mad Men.  I found an electric heating pad and
would use it on my lower back when I was in bed or sitting at my chair reading.
I fell asleep at my desk, and woke up feeling pretty hopeless.  I had a list of one
hundred books that I was going to read. 




I texted Lena, telling her that I was home.  She responded that we should hang
out some time. 

I arrived at her house.  Her dad joked and smiled at me, he was sort of chubby.
I felt distant, strange nostalgia about Lena, sitting up in her room and talking
about what's been up in her life.  She kept asking me what I was up to...

"I've been reading a lot about demons, heretics...it's really interesting
stuff."

I felt pathetic.  We were in her basement, looking at her music collection.

DECEMBER 2011-->AUGUST 2012:


AUGUST 2012-->DECEMBER 2013:

I stared at the math book in dismay.  I started to read the third of nine
chapters that were going to be tested.  I had to reread sentences, I was
not understanding.  After a few minutes every few sentences my eyes would close
and I'd shake myself awake.  My eyes closed for a while.

I soon woke up angry.  I couldn't do this.  It was stupid.  I bit my tongue and
took out a notebook, and restarted reading the paragraph, writing down the
progression of equations.  I felt more awake and filled with a little
adrenaline.   
DECEMBER 2013-->AUGUST 2014:



AUGUST 2014--> ???:
"Did you see that your restaurant closed?"
"Yeah."

META:
What are some of the overarching themes/ideas that you want to communicate?
Maybe you should MATCH the tone of your thoughts during the time.  Kind of James
Joyce-y!  Which is a good thing.

I like this idea.
"How Would I Have Written About It Then"
things are boring/tricky in retrospect
When YOU write about things in a faux-minimalist way it's really boring.
bad sentence: "I wrote sentences like: "
