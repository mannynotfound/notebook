          To an outside observer, this probably sounds like risky and extreme
          behavior.  To me, it mostly felt like a positive development: I had

          didn't want to ever have to eat it, if that makes sense.  By covertly
          accessing all of the digital information about the lives of the people
          in my life, I suddenly could have my cake, every day.  I felt the
          sense of connection to other people and the world that I had always

        The methods used to accomplish most cracking-style hacks are almost
        embarassing to me.  If the general public realized that most hackers
        exploit "social engineering" tricks of the trade, like common criminals,
        hackers would get a whole lot less respect.  It's not byzantine computer
        knowledge that makes a hacker a hacker, it's a lack
        of shame and a lot of dumb targets.
        <br><br>
        Abuse of trust is one of the most effective ways to gain access to
        valuable data.  Part of Facebook's culture is that Facebook ostensibly
        places a high level of trust in its employees.  [More on that here].  I
        think most people are unwilling to steal data from their employers due
        to organizational loyalty, intense punishments when caught, and the
        difficulty of finding a buyer for that information.  On a personal
        level, something else seems to stop people from violating each other's
        personal data.  For my purposes, opening up someone's laptop and
        clicking through their files is the same as reading their diary.   
        <br><br>
        What does it mean, that most people, if left alone in a room with one of
        their friend's diaries, would respect that friend's privacy and leave it
        alone?  To me, this is strange.  The information in that diary could
        potentially really benefit them in the long run, perhaps deepen the
        relationship with that friend, or make you realize that you should stop
        being friends with that person.  The friend is unlikely to be hurt by
        your having read the diary.  Does this mean that people would rather
        ~not~ know the truth about the relationships in their lives, or believe
        that not knowing the truth is ideal?  Or, does this mean that many people
        are fundamentally uninterested in the mental lives of their friends?
        These explanations all seem plausible to me.  Or, there may just be very
        effective taboos in place that prevent any well-socialized individuals
        from reading private information.
        <br><br>
        The first time I violated someone's privacy was a simple passive case of
        abused trust.
        <br><br>
        I wrote a story about the experience, and when I showed it to Marie, she
        blocked me and never spoke to me again.
        <br><br>
        It seems that the truth is a lot more brutal than most people think.  Or
        at least it is brutal with regards me and my life.

	This is a story from when I was younger, during the messy "medical leave
	from Cornell" period of my life.  The summer before I returned to
	school, I got an internship in New York via an internet friend.  I
	thought that my New York internship was a sign that I had arrived at
	something close to a final truth about adult life, and was ready to put

    <div data-nid="tom" class="node">                    
        <br> I'd trade everything I have to be a pretty boy, or I guess a pretty
        girl.  When I was in high school, I had a sense that my physical
        appearance and mannerisms grossed people at a fundamental level.  This
        feeling has diminished over time, but I think this insecurity led to my
        fascination with Tom.  

        After moving to New York and starting my job, I met my girlfriend,
        Marissa, almost immediately.  Tom was her ex.  They were still friends.  

        "I know this seems like a dick move", said Marissa, "but you should hang
        out with Tom.  You guys are both into computers."

        It became clear, over the course of a few nights out, that Tom was what
        I had always wanted to be.  But I also discovered that he was fragile.

        On one of these fragile nights I helped Tom to a cab.  He left his
        jacket with me, and in his jacket was his phone.  I messaged him on
        facebook that he could pick it up anytime.

        His phone wasn't locked, and I immediately started looking through his
        recent messages.  I didn't think much of it.  I spent the rest of the
        day reading everything I could find.

        I searched for my name.

        "Yeah, he was nice.  Kind of boring though," Tom had said to Marissa.

        "Oh?" said Marissa.

        "You made him seem a lot more interesting.  He just talked about work
        and money," Tom continued.  Marissa defended me, and they had a subdued
        fight where...

        Facebook's search function found only one other conversation where I was
        named explicitly.

        Tom talked to so many people, all the time.  This was surprising to me,
        because I barely ever saw him using his phone.  It was hard to
        understand what made him message "hey" to six or seven people at once.
        Some of the conversations would go somewhere, other's wouldn't.
        Randomly, Tom would have an intense conversation with someone, where he
        really spilled his guts.  In a plaintive tone, he would talk about his
        stressors.

    <div class="node" data-nid="own_life_scrutiny">
        While reading through the old messages of friends and lovers, I
        sometimes ended up reading conversations from my own past.  I usually
        felt the familiar dread and pain that came  with seeing myself as others
        saw me.  None of the messages were old enough to allow for the
        possibility that I'd changed since sending them.  A person with more
        willpower might have used the pain of these messages as motivation to
        change himself.  A more humble person might have realized that she
        should be kinder to others.  A person with more hustle might have
        stopped reading, to avoid any loss of self-confidence or accumulation of
        self-consciousness.  For me, my own messages were mostly just an
        unpleasant reminder of a reality that I thought I had haphazardly
        transcended, or avoided.

        It was surprising that within a month of moving to New York, I was
        in a relationship, sleeping with someone that really lit up my life.
        <br><br>
        Marissa was my first adult relationship, I think.  It was more than a
        little surreal: us, on Christmas eve, dancing in front of our small
        Christmas tree, staring into each other's eyes, only half drunk.  The
        amount of comfort and pleasure we managed to enjoy during any given weekend
        never ceased to surprise me.  We were two young people who had perfectly
        achieved our "goals", but could barely remember our dreams.
        <br><br> 
        Marissa was a banker, but she made being a banker look easy.  She didn't
        really buy into the whole "insane work hours" thing.  She was effective
        and composed, and had a moderate, genuine interest in the financial
        services industry.  Despite her lack of interest in office politics, she
        knew that she would not be fired.  Also, she was attractive.  Blonde.
        She looked like a female banker. 
        <br><br>
        The only thing that hinted at her past was the fact that she wore too
        much perfume.  I think I have a thing for women -- (I always make a point
        to call the "girls" of our generation "women") -- I think I have a thing
        for women who wear too much perfume.

        The rowing machine was the only sacred object in my apartment.  It
        was situated so that I could see the Manhattan skyline while I
        rowed, and in the late fall and winter my heart was moved by the slow
        pulsing of the warning lights across the river.

        My parents were confused by the young adult I became in college, and
        when I walked on to the rowing team, they had clung to my identity
        as a rower as one of the few positive facts they knew about me.  As
        a result, almost all of my Christmas gifts during those years were
        rowing related.  These gifts hung on the wall next to the rowing
        machine: a hand drawn poster from the 1920's commemorating Ivy
        League crews, parts of antique rowing shells, and, "embarassingly",
        pictures of me racing at Eastern Sprints and the IRAs.  When people

        When I arrived at Cornell for my sophomore year, I was determined to set
        myself up for a prestigious internship.  In early September I put on my
        blazer and went to the career fair.  I spent most of the day in the
        buzzing indoor track building, talking to employers. 
        <br><br>
        I found that I enjoyed talking to the tech companies more than the
        banks.  It was always very difficult to discern what exactly I was
        talking about when I was talking to the financial services companies.
        With the tech companies, I was able to stretch my superficial knowledge
        of programming in order to have interesting discussions with the
        recruiters.  Many of them seemed to want to believe that they were doing
        something really special, technology-wise.  A fat neckbeard representing
        an ad tech company made a lasting impression on me by asking if I knew
        what Hadoop was.  
        <br><br>
        "No, what is it?" I asked.<br>
        "Oh, man.  The next big thing.  The current big thing," he said,
        rocking back and forth.<br>
        "Like, what is it though?"<br>
        "It's Apache's distributed MapReduce framework.  It's how we can process
        millions of ad slots a minute.  You should really look it up."
        <br><br>
        I did google it, and felt the familiar sense of wondering what was
        really going on: was this, and NoSQL, or NodeJS, just significant
        buzzwords, used like the names of bands in high school, or the different
        sectors at a bank?   Over a year later, I would smile when my
        Database Systems class required us to implement the PageRank algorithm
        using the Hadoop framework.  Computer Science had turned out to be more
        than emptiness, for me.
        <br><br>
        And a year after ~that~, one of the men indirectly responsible for the
        creation of Hadoop spoke in my Information Retrieval class.  I was
        fascinated, because I had already watched a video of him talk about the
        role of 9/11 in Google's history, and had developed a pet theory: that
        the attack on the Twin Towers had led to the creation of the Map Reduce
        programming paradigm, and in turn the Hadoop framework that enabled many
        of the "big data" applications of the later 2000s.
        <br><br>
        <img src="images/amit.jpg">
        <br><br>
        Amit Singhal, director of search quality at Google, was away at a
        conference on September 11th, 2001. As the public searched for news
        about the attacks on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon, Amit and his
        colleagues realized that Google was dramatically failing to meet the nation's
        information need. Searches for "World Trade Center" led to web pages
        detailing the architecture of the now-destroyed buildings, or real
        estate listings.  This was due to the fact that Google was only able to
        index the internet about once a month: the index used to fulfill
        searches did not reflect the current, dramatically different reality.
        Over a conference call, Amit and the Google engineers decided on a hacky
        solution: they simply added links to relevant news articles on Google's
        homepage.  This didn't work: the massive amounts of traffic directed to
        these articles caused the news network's servers to crash almost
        instantly.
        <br><br>
        Amit and Krishna Bararat, a search architecture engineer, were trapped
        at the conference center in upstate New York until planes were allowed
        to fly again.  Over the next few days, they sketched out the
        architecture of what would become Google News, a system that would index
        news websites constantly, ensuring that Google would be able to provide
        information about events that had just happened.  Building this system
        would require rethinking Google's entire data pipeline.  New programming
        models for distributed systems would need to be perfected in order to
        have enough computing power to simulataneously index thousands of news
        websites.
        <br><br>
        Over the next few years, Google News was developed, but Amit and Google
        realizes that just about everything needed to be indexed in "real time".
        In order to index the whole internet, every day, the programming methods
        used to create Google News would have to be formalized.  In addition,
        Google realized that the rest of the internet had to catch up with
        Google.  To address both of these concerns, in 2003 Krishna released
        "the MapReduce paper", which detailed the abstractions used by Google to
        think about their complicated distributed systems.  
        <br><br>
        Something about the nature of MapReduce always felt very current and
        zeitgeisty to me, perhaps because of the adtech neckbeard at career
        fair, or perhaps because the MapReduce paradigm of millions of isolated
        units of data being accumulated, fragmented by a inscrutable hash
        function, and reduced to useful key-value pairs reminded me of the way
        real life was starting to work.
        <br><br>
    </div>
    <div data-nid="system" class="node">
        <br><br>
        I developed a pretty safe system for reading arbritary messages from
        Facebook messenger.  One of my (self-assigned) tasks was developing an
        effective test framework for the Hadoop message retrieval system, and I
        built the test suite so that it could retrieve messages specified by an
        encrypted query as a side-effect of running the tests.  The set-up and
        tear down phase of the test would remove any identifying information
        about the "test" messages retrieved, "for security purposes", leaving
        only a daily audit log explaining the accesses.  
        <br><br>
        I knew this power was too special to use for just making money or
        something, but too dangerous to do much of anything else with.  Once my
        system worked well, I made an effort to delude myself that I was doing
        nothing wrong, in case I got caught somehow.  I became an advocate for
        end-to-end encryption, and increased internal security that would
        prevent others from doing what I had done.  I figured if someone
        reversed engineered the hidden functionality of my code, I would just
        point out that this was exactly why we needed client-side encryption.
        There were secuity holes everywhere, I wouldn't get in trouble for
        having unwittingly created one, especially if I had a proposal that
        would effectively eliminate it.
