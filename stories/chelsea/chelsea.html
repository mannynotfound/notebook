        Before moving to New York, I made two promises to myself: that I would
        <span data-nid="working_charm" class="link">row five kilometers a
            day</span>, and that I would <span data-nid="working_charm"
            class="link">focus exclusively on "work"
            while at work</span>.  I believed that if I followed these two rules, I could
        avoid most post-grad nightmares.</span><br><br>
        In the fall of my senior year at Cornell, I got a software engineering
        job at Facebook.  When I got the offer email, saw the money ($120k) and
        forwarded it to my parents, I knew that my sad plans for being a poor
        writer, hacker, artist were now nothing more than an embarassing memory.
        I felt lucky and relieved, like Facebook had made some sort of mistake
        in hiring me, or that I'd gotten technical interview questions perfectly
        suited for my abilities.  But maybe depsite, or because of, my struggles
        in college, I was meant to get that job.  I'm not sure.
        <span data-nid="changes" class="replace"> Accepting the offer led to <span
                data-nid="changes" class="link">dramatic changes in my character, and in how I
        related to other people.</span><br /></span> <br /> Just two years after
        graduation, I found myself in a nightmare of New York, looking at the
        childhood stuffed animals sitting by my monitor, wondering if they
        served the same purpose as photographs given to androids: to provide a
        physical anchor for false and implanted memories of a life before.

    <div data-nid="changes" class="node">
        <br>
        The biggest change is that I developed an interest in 'hacking' the
        devices and accounts of the people in my life.  To the outside observer,
        this probably sounds pretty scandalous and extreme.  To me, most of the
        time, it felt like a positive development: I had finally found my
        passion as a programmer.  
        <span class="link replace" data-nid="beauty"> I had found the place

    <div data-nid="beauty" class="node">
        <br><br> My whole life I had felt that I was surrounded by stories of
          beauty that I couldn't access because I was relatively introverted,
          didn't possess a strong speaking voice, etc.  I wanted my cake, but I
          didn't want to ever have to eat it, if that makes sense.  By covertly
          accessing all of the digital information about the lives of the people
          in my life, I suddenly could have my cake, every day.  I felt the
          sense of connection to other people and the world that I had always
          craved.

        <span class="link" data-nid="tom">the story of the first person I "hacked"</span>

        <br><br>
        The methods used to accomplish most cracking-style hacks are almost
        embarassing to me.  If the general public realized that most hackers
        exploit "social engineering" tricks of the trade, like common criminals,
        hackers would get a whole lot less respect.  It's not byzantine computer
        knowledge that makes a hacker a hacker, it's a lack
        of shame and a lot of dumb targets.
        <br><br>
        Abuse of trust is one of the most effective ways to gain access to
        valuable data.  Part of Facebook's culture is that Facebook ostensibly
        places a high level of trust in its employees.  [More on that here].  I
        think most people are unwilling to steal data from their employers due
        to organizational loyalty, intense punishments when caught, and the
        difficulty of finding a buyer for that information.  On a personal
        level, something else seems to stop people from violating each other's
        personal data.  For my purposes, opening up someone's laptop and
        clicking through their files is the same as reading their diary.   
        <br><br>
        What does it mean, that most people, if left alone in a room with one of
        their friend's diaries, would respect that friend's privacy and leave it
        alone?  To me, this is strange.  The information in that diary could
        potentially really benefit them in the long run, perhaps deepen the
        relationship with that friend, or make you realize that you should stop
        being friends with that person.  The friend is unlikely to be hurt by
        your having read the diary.  Does this mean that people would rather
        ~not~ know the truth about the relationships in their lives, or believe
        that not knowing the truth is ideal?  Or, does this mean that many people
        are fundamentally uninterested in the mental lives of their friends?
        These explanations all seem plausible to me.  Or, there may just be very
        effective taboos in place that prevent any well-socialized individuals
        from reading private information.
        <br><br>
        The first time I violated someone's privacy was a simple passive case of
        abused trust.
        <br><br>
        I wrote a story about the experience, and when I showed it to Marie, she
        blocked me and never spoke to me again.
        <br><br>
        It seems that the truth is a lot more brutal than most people think.  Or
        at least it is brutal with regards me and my life.

    <div class="node" data-nid="tom">                    
        <br> I'd trade everything I have to be a pretty boy, or I guess a pretty
        girl.  When I was in high school, I had a sense that my physical
        appearance and mannerisms grossed people at a fundamental level.  This
        feeling has diminished over time, but I think this insecurity led to my
        fascination with Tom.  

        Upon moving to New York and starting my job, I met a girlfriend almost
        immediately, named Marissa.  Tom was her ex.  They were still friends.  

        "I know this seems like a dick move", said Marissa, "but you should hang
        out with Tom.  You guys are both into computers."

        Tom had broken up with Marissa.  It seemed to me like Tom had dumped
        Marissa, because he wanted to be single.  

        It became clear, over the course of a few nights out, that Tom was what
        I had always wanted to be.  But I also discovered that he was fragile.

        On one of these fragile nights I helped Tom to a cab.  He left his
        jacket with me, and in his jacket was his phone.  I messaged him on
        facebook that he could pick it up anytime.

        His phone wasn't locked, and I immediately started looking through his
        recent messages.  I didn't think much of it.  I spent the rest of the
        day reading everything I could find.

        I searched for my name.

        "Yeah, he was nice.  Kind of boring though," Tom had said to Marissa.

        "Oh?" said Marissa.

        "You made him seem a lot more interesting.  He just talked about work
        and money," Tom continued.  Marissa defended me, and they had a subdued
        fight where...

        Facebook's search function found only one other conversation where I was
        named explicitly.

        Tom talked to so many people, all the time.  This was surprising to me,
        because I barely ever saw him using his phone.  It was hard to
        understand what made him message "hey" to six or seven people at once.
        Some of the conversations would go somewhere, other's wouldn't.
        Randomly, Tom would have an intense conversation with someone, where he
        really spilled his guts.  In a plaintive tone, he would talk about his
        stressors.

    </div>
    <div class="node" data-nid="boring-tease">
            It was just Tom discussing who to invite out, one night two weeks

    <div class="node" data-nid="own_life_scrutiny">
        While reading through the old messages of friends and lovers, I
        sometimes ended up reading conversations from my own past.  I usually
        felt the familiar dread and pain that came  with seeing myself as others
        saw me.  None of the messages were old enough to allow for the
        possibility that I'd changed since sending them.  A person with more
        willpower might have used the pain of these messages as motivation to
        change himself.  A more humble person might have realized that she
        should be kinder to others.  A person with more hustle might have
        stopped reading, to avoid any loss of self-confidence or accumulation of
        self-consciousness.  For me, my own messages were mostly just an
        unpleasant reminder of a reality that I thought I had haphazardly
        transcended, or avoided.
    </div>
    <div class="node" data-nid="marissa">
        I only had one girlfriend during college, and one abortive "hookup".
        Thus, it was surprising that within a month of moving to New York, I was
        in a relationship with someone that I really liked.  Marissa really lit
        up my life.  I found her both mysterious and pleasant; I was happy to be
        dating someone who was appealing to me on so many levels.  It felt like
        we were both proper young adults, at the exact same place in life
        together, but each with our own inner lives that gave lustre to our eyes
        and made conversation interesting.  
        <br><br>

        She felt like my first adult relationship, a relationship that would be
        reasonably attractive if filmed.  It was more than a little surreal: us,
        on Christmas eve, dancing in front of the Christmas tree in out
        apartment, staring into each other's eyes, only half drunk.  The amount
        of pleasantness and pleasure we managed to enjoy on any given weekend
        was incredible.  We were two young people who had perfectly achieved our
        "goals", but could barely remember our dreams.
        <br><br>
        Marissa was a banker, but she made being a banker look easy.  She didn't
        really buy into the whole "work insane hours" thing.  It was certainly
        within her power to work hours like that, and she still put in a solid
        10 hours a day, but I think she managed to make her (mostly male)
        coworkers look foolish through her sheer competence and composure.  She
        knew she wouldn't be a banker forever, so office politics were not very
        important to her success, and she was very effective, so she would not
        be fired.  She was also unusually attractive.  She looked like a female
        banker. 
        <br><br>
        We cheated on each other so much.  Too much perfume.

        The rowing machine was the only sacred object in my apartment.  It

        rowed, and in the late fall and winter my heart was moved by the slow
        pulsing of the warning lights across the river.

        My parents were confused by the young adult I became in college, and
        when I walked on to the rowing team, they had clung to my identity
        as a rower as one of the few positive facts they knew about me.  As
        a result, almost all of my Christmas gifts during those years were
        rowing related.  These gifts hung on the wall next to the rowing
        machine: a hand drawn poster from the 1920's commemorating Ivy
        League crews, parts of antique rowing shells, and, "embarassingly",
        pictures of me racing at Eastern Sprints and the IRAs.  When people
        made fun of my shrine, I reminded myself that these items were proof

        When I arrived back at Cornell for my sophomore year, I was determined
        to set myself up for a prestigious internship.  In early September I put
        on a blazer and went to the annual career fair.  I spent almost
        the whole day in the buzzing indoor track building, talking to
        employers.  I found that I enjoyed talking to the tech companies more
        than the banks.
        <br><br>
        I quickly found that I enjoyed talking to the tech companies more than
        the banks.  It was always very difficult to discern what exactly I was
        talking about when I was talking to the banks.  With the tech companies,
        I was able to stretch my superficial knowledge of programming in order
        to have interesting discussions with the recruiters.  Many of them
        seemed to want to believe that they were doing something really special,
        technology-wise.  A fat neckbeard representing an ad tech company made a
        lasting impression on me by asking if I knew what Hadoop was.  
        <br><br>
        "No, what is it?" I asked.
        "Oh, man.  The next big thing.  The current big thing," he said,
        rocking back and forth.
        "Like, what is it though?"
        "It's Apache's distributed MapReduce framework.  It's how we can process
        millions of ad slots a minute.  You should really look it up."
        <br><br>
        I did google it, and felt the familiar sense of wondering what was
        really going on: was this, and NoSQL, or NodeJS, just significant
        buzzwords, used like the names of bands in high school, or the different
        sectors at a bank?   Over a year later, I would smile when my
        Database Systems class required us to implement the PageRank algorithm
        using the Hadoop framework.  Computer Science had turned out to be more
        than emptiness, for me.
        <br><br>
        And a year after ~that~, one of the men indirectly responsible for the
        creation of Hadoop spoke in my Information Retrieval class.  I was
        fascinated, because I had already watched a video of him talk about the
        role of 9/11 in Google's history, and had developed a pet theory: that
        the attack on the Twin Towers had led to the creation of the Map Reduce
        programming paradigm, and in turn the Hadoop framework that enabled many
        of the "big data" applications of the later 2000s.

        Amit Singhal, director of search quality at Google, was away at a
        conference in on September 11th, 2001. As the public searched for
        information about the collapse of the towers and the attack on the
        Pentagon, Amit and his colleagues realized that Google was failing
        terribly at meeting the nation's information need.

        <br><br>
        I developed a pretty safe system for reading arbritary messages from
        Facebook messenger.  One of my (self-assigned) tasks was developing an
        effective test framework for the Hadoop message retrieval system, and I
        built the test suite so that it could retrieve messages specified by an
        encrypted query as a side-effect of running the tests.  The set-up and
        tear down phase of the test would remove any identifying information
        about the "test" messages retrieved, "for security purposes", leaving
        only a daily audit log explaining the accesses.  
        <br><br>
        I knew this power was too special to use for just making money or
        something, but too dangerous to do much of anything else with.  Once my
        system worked well, I made an effort to delude myself that I was doing
        nothing wrong, in case I got caught somehow.  I became an advocate for
        end-to-end encryption, and increased internal security that would
        prevent others from doing what I had done.  I figured if someone
        reversed engineered the hidden functionality of my code, I would just
        point out that this was exactly why we needed client-side encryption.
        There were secuity holes everywhere, I wouldn't get in trouble for
        having unwittingly created one, especially if I had a proposal that
        would effectively eliminate it.
