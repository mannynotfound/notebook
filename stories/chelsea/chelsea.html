            Before moving to New York, I made two promises to myself: that I
            would row five kilometers a day, and that I would do nothing but
            "work" while at work.  I believed that if I followed these two
            rules, I could avoid most post-grad nightmare hells.
            <br><br>
            In the fall of my senior year at Cornell, I got a software engineering job at Facebook.
            It was sort of a surprise:  I'd been planning on being a poor hacker/writer/artist.  But
            I figured, why not <span class="link" data-nid="mornings">work for
                Facebook?</span><span class="replace"
                data-nid="mornings"></span>  I'd meet some good programmers, make $120k a
            year.  Maybe that's what I deserved, despite, or because of, my struggles in college.
            <br><br>
            <span data-nid="changes" class="replace"> Accepting the offer led to <span
                    data-nid="changes" class="link">dramatic changes in my character, and in how I
                    related to other people.</span><br /></span> <br /><br>
            Just two years after graduation, I found myself in a nightmare of New York, looking at the
            childhood stuffed animals sitting by my monitor, wondering if they served the same purpose as
            photographs given to androids: to provide a physical anchor for false and implanted memories of
            a life before.

            The biggest change is that I developed an interest in 'hacking' the devices and accounts
            of the people in my life.  To the outside observer, this probably sounds pretty
            scandalous and extreme.  To me, most of the time, it felt like a positive development: I
            had finally found my passion as a programmer.  
                <span class="link replace" data-nid="beauty"> I had found the place where my interests
                in programming and literature intersected.</span>

            My whole life I had felt that I was surrounded by stories of beauty
            that I couldn't access because I was relatively introverted, didn't
            possess a strong speaking voice, etc.  I wanted my cake, but I
            didn't want to ever have to eat it, if that makes sense.  By
            covertly accessing all of the digital information about the lives of
            the people in my life, I suddenly could have my cake, every day.  I
            felt the sense of connection to other people and the world that I
            had always craved.

                <span class="link" data-nid="tom">the story of the first person I "hacked"</span> 
                is interesting, and personal. It involved someone beautiful, a newfound sense of
                power, humilation, and what felt like victory. </span> 
            Subsequent "hackings" have been much softer.  Softness has fallen on my life.  Softness
            and mild pain like a New England Christmas morning.

            I'd trade everything I have to be a pretty boy, or I guess a pretty girl.  When
            I was in high school, I had a sense that my physical appearance and mannerisms
            grossed people at a fundamental level.  This fall has diminished over time, but
            I think this insecurity led to my fascination with Tom.  

            Upon moving to New York and starting my job, I met a girlfriend almost
            immediately, named Marissa.  Tom was her ex.  They were still friends.  

            "I know this seems like a dick move", said Marissa, "but you should hang out
            with Tom.  You guys are both into computers."

            Tom had broken up with Marissa.  It seemed to me like Tom had dumped Marissa,
            because he wanted to be single.  

            It became clear, over the course of a few nights out, that Tom was what I had
            always wanted to be.  But I also discovered that he was fragile.

            On one of these fragile nights I helped Tom to a cab.  He left his jacket with
            me, and in his jacket was his phone.  I messaged him on facebook that he could
            pick it up anytime.

            His phone wasn't locked, and I immediately started looking through his recent
            messages.  I didn't think much of it.  I spent the rest of the day reading
            everything I could find.

            I searched for my name.

            "Yeah, he was nice.  Kind of boring though," Tom had said to Marissa.

            "Oh?" said Marissa.

            "You made him seem a lot more interesting.  He just talked about work and
            money," Tom continued.  Marissa defended me, and they had a subdued fight
            where...

            Facebook's search function found only one other conversation where I was named
            explicitly.

            Tom talked to so many people, all the time.  This was surprising to me, because
            I barely ever saw him using his phone.  It was hard to understand what made him
            message "hey" to six or seven people at once.  Some of the conversations would
            go somewhere, other's wouldn't.  Randomly, Tom would have an intense
            conversation with someone, where he really spilled his guts.  In a plaintive
            tone, he would talk about his stressors.

            It was just Tom discussing who to invite out, one night two weeks
            ago.

        <div class="text">
            While reading through the old messages of friends and lovers, I
            sometimes ended up reading conversations from my own past.
            I usually felt the familiar dread and pain that
            came  with seeing myself as others saw me.  None of the
            messages were old enough to allow for the possibility that
            I'd changed since sending them.  A person with more willpower
            might have used the pain of these messages as motivation to change
            himself.  A more humble person might have realized that she should
            be kinder to others.  A person with more hustle might have stopped reading,
            to avoid any loss of self-confidence or accumulation of
            self-consciousness.  For me, my own messages were mostly just an
            unpleasant reminder of a reality that I thought I had haphazardly
            transcended, or avoided.

            I only had one girlfriend during college, and one abortive "hookup".
            Thus, it was surprising that within a month of moving to New York, I
            was in a relationship with someone that I really liked.  Marissa
            really lit up my life.  I found her both mysterious and pleasant; I
            was happy to be dating someone who was appealing to me on so many
            levels.  It felt like we were both proper young adults, at the exact
            same place in life together, but each with our own inner lives that gave
            lustre to our eyes and made conversation interesting.  

            We cheated on each other so much.
            Too much perfume.

            My job was beautiful in the mornings.  I'd wake up and drink a glass
            of ice water, and then row on the rowing machine <span class="link
                " data-nid="rowing_machine">rowing machine</span>.<span
                class="replace" data-nid="rowing_machine"></span>

            The rowing machine was the only sacred object in my apartment.  It
            was situated so that I could see the Manhattan skyline while I
            rowed.  I anticipated the late fall and winter because I could row
            in the dark, and see the warning lights on the buildings across the
            river pulsing slowly. 
            <br />
           
            My parents were confused by the young adult I became in
            college, and when I walked on to the rowing team, they had clung
            to my identity as a rower as one of the few positive facts they knew
            about me.  As a result, almost all of my Christmas gifts during
            those years were rowing related.  These gifts hung on the wall next
            to the rowing machine: a hand drawn poster from the 1920's
            commemorating Ivy League crews, parts of antique rowing shells, and,
            "embarassingly", pictures of me racing at Eastern Sprints and the
            IRAs.  When people made fun of my shrine, I reminded myself that
            these items were proof that my parents loved me more than any of
            them.
