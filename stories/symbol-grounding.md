# Symbol Grounding

*An upstanding young programmer serves as the test subject of a new "direct
semantic IO" machine.*

When Feyerabend received an invitation to spend the next year working with
Addison Chen and her team in Poland, she responded immediately, and pushed
herself away from her desk. She walked to the kitchen, her upper body dancing to
the pop music on the office soundsystem.  

"You're in a good mood," said Roberto.  He was sitting at an awkwardly shaped
plastic table, working on a terminal.

"Yes," replied Feyerabend.  "A project I've been working on is going well."

"Nice!"  Roberto let the conversation die by looking back down at his computer,
squinting in the autumn sunset light.

Feyerabend got pita chips and hummus, and went to another table to think.

This was probably be the best moment of her life, Feyerabend thought.  This was
it, and it was really good.  This was everything paying off at once.

Feyerabend had spent ten years at University, studying grammar.  Whenever her
classmates had gone out to jobs, they'd always treated her with a sort of pity,
asking passive-aggressive questions like "what applications do you see for this
research?", etc.

Feyerabend had always been certain that the best way to spend one's life was
trying to add some new understanding to the world.  Everything else would be
dismal.  And now she felt validated: Addison Chen's direct semantic IO project
was valuable, and apparently her contributions to it were also valuable.
Feyerabend felt more certain of this than anything else in the world, now, and
this meant that a deep dark hole in her life was now filled with gold.  She had
experienced irreversible steps forward in the past, and this was the biggest
one.  There would always be something that she could rest her mind on, use to
assuage anxieties if she was having trouble falling asleep or felt useless.

She knew that, almost certainly, the work she would do with Edison Chen would
live on beyond her, and provide a baseline of her unhappiness.

Even though Feyerabend would be living in Poland for over a year, it felt like
she was going on an exciting vacation.  

When Feyerabend arrived in Warsaw, they gave her a whole week to 'get situated'
in her new apartment.  An email from Emma Chen explicitly suggested that she not
do any work.  Feyerabend decided to go along with this, and had a really
relaxing week.  Her new apartment was quite large, with three bedrooms and two
bathrooms.  The build quality of the fixtures and furniture wasn't amazing, but
it was spacious and comfortable.

The protagonist takes chemical castration medication, and is a pretty
upstanding, idealistic person.  The world in general is an improved, a positive
late capitalism.  



The protagonist interacts with the other character via a computer program they
wrote.

Choosing the gender of the characters seems very difficult, critical.

A very clear, discrete presence in his mind, at a very precise point.

Now in the world there was the voice of her thoughts, the swell and grind of her
emotions, and this new third fast whisper.  It communicated clearly

The story ends without any major conflict, merely technical challenges and a
"difficult conversation" that exposes difficult realities that the characters
must confront.
