# Symbol Grounding

*An upstanding young programmer serves as the test subject of a new "direct
semantic IO" machine.*

When Feyerabend received an invitation to spend the next year working with
Addison Chen and her team in Poland, she responded immediately, and pushed
herself away from her desk. She walked to the kitchen, her upper body dancing to
the pop music on the office soundsystem.  

"You're in a good mood," said Roberto.  He was sitting at an awkwardly shaped
plastic table, working on a terminal.

"Yes," replied Feyerabend.  "A project I've been working on is going well."

"Nice!"  Roberto looked back down at his computer, squinting in the autumn
sunset light.

Feyerabend got pita chips and hummus, and went to another table to think.

This was probably be the best moment of her life, Feyerabend thought.  This was
it, and it was really good.  This was everything paying off at once.

Feyerabend had spent ten years at University, studying grammar.  Whenever her
classmates had gone out to jobs, they'd always treated her with a sort of pity,
asking passive-aggressive questions like "what applications do you see for this
research?", etc.

And now she felt validated: Addison Chen's direct semantic IO project was
valuable, and apparently her contributions to it were also valuable.  She would
contribute new understanding to the world.  Feyerabend felt more certain of this
than anything else in the world, and this meant that a deep dark hole in her
life was now filled with gold.  She had experienced irreversible steps forward
in the past, and this was the biggest one.  She would never feel truly useless
again, when she was having trouble falling asleep.

Feyerabend cleaned up her snack, and went back to her desk.  A notification was
waiting for her, saying that $20,000 had been deposited to her account for
relocation costs.  Feyerabend was impressed that the organization somehow knew
her bank account number, and was able to move money to it instantly. 

<hr>

Even though Feyerabend would be living in Poland for over a year, it felt like
she was going on an exciting vacation.  The HR people at her company sort of
nodded and smiled when she explained she was leaving to work on an open source
project, with people she had never met.  

When Feyerabend arrived in Warsaw, an email from Addison Chen explicitly
suggested that she spend a week not working and 'getting situated'.  Feyerabend
decided to go along with this.  Her new apartment was quite large, with three
bedrooms and two bathrooms, set back from the road in a stand of oak trees.  The
build quality of the fixtures and furniture wasn't amazing, but it was new,
spacious and comfortable.

The next day was warm and summery, and Feyerabend decided to go to one of the
outdoor swimming pools she had seen on the ride from the airport.  She sat on a
towel, reading a non-grammar-related book.  It was the first time Feyerabend had
taken a serious, unstructured break in her life.   She watched families grilling
things and jumping in the pool together.  

Feyerabend wondered what it would be like meeting Addison on Monday.  It
probably wouldn't be particularly uncomfortable: there would be so many things
to talk about.  The abstract synatax tree, the results of the hardware tests,
Feyerabend's whitepaper proposal for a codepoint plane.  

It might be a bit weird, but Feyerabend was experienced with meeting colleagues
from the Internet.  She found that most people were not surprised that she was
trans: to most people, it was sort of obvious from the picture on her website.
The communication problems would work themselves out.

<hr>

Spending most of the day in the sun, wandering around the pastel and grey city,
reminded Feyerabend of being a teenager.  Feyerabend knew that she was still
young in the abstract sense, but her week of freedom brought back memories of a
different period of her life, when there was much more time.  Ever since her
early twenties, Feyerabend had been constantly aware that each day could not be
wasted, and had generally lived accordingly.  It was only out of obedience to
the project that she was going through with this week off.

She drank at dinner alone, and gave the cab driver a slip of paper with her
address on it.  Back in her strange apartment, she looked at herself in the
mirror and quieted old dysphoric feelings. 

A sense of baseless anxiety, like she had taken some sort of speedy drug and was
trying to convince herself that everything was okay.

<hr>

A little after sunrise on Monday morning, a driver picked Feyerabend up from her
apartment.  Feyerabend fell asleep in the car, awaking when they arrived.  The
driver laughed, and led her into a marble building enclosed by a glass atrium.

After walking through a few industrial hallways, Feyerabend was shown directly
to her new office, a room with a bookshelf, a coffee table, and windows.  The
driver left, and Feyerabend spent a few minutes organizing the things in her
bag.

Someone pushed open the door, sticking only his head in.

"Leah?" the person said.  He had a French accent.

"Hello," said Feyerabend, standing up.  

The person introduced himself, saying that he was also a researcher.  He was
unusually friendly for a French person, Feyerabend thought.  They walked to a
meeting room, and the researcher asked Feyerabend what she thought about Warsaw.

"The people working on the project go out for dinner together, sometimes, I like
that," he said.

Talk shifted quickly to their work.  The researcher said that he mostly worked
on the project's hardware, but had read through all of Feyerabend's RFCs, and
thought they were all very well-considered. 

"Do you have any insight into whether or not I will be involved with the
hardware aspect of the project?" asked Feyerabend.

"Well, you'll be working with the hardware almost constantly.  That's the main
reason why the organization decided to fund your residency here."

"It's not an area I have much expertise in," said Feyerabend, somewhat
excitedly.  The researcher smiled.

"We've developed a fairly straightforward user interface for the focused
ultrasound CBI machine, I'll be interested in your feedback on it.  Shall we go
take a look at it?"

"The CBI device?  Now?" 

"Sure," said the researcher.  "Addison should be working with it, I think, so
you can meet her as well."

Feyerabend was very excited about the prospect of a whole year with a
medical-grade computer-brain interface.  At university, she had worked with
transcranial magnetic stimulation machines, and an Internet friend had once
demonstrated the use of a focused ultrasound effector on a rat for her benefit,
but tests on the project's focused ultrasound device had shown that its spatial
and temporaral resolutions were both higher by at least a few orders of
magnitude.  Feyerabend's proposals depended on the reality of this hardware.

On the way to Addison Chen's lab, the French researcher showed her the break
room, containing only a refrigerator and a coffee machine.  The room containing
the focused ultrasound effector was similar.  The machine was not yet encased in
white medical plastic: it looked like a delicate industrial robot, with a large
number of modular microprocessor boards connected to custom components.

Addison Chen

It was quickly obvious why the distributed autonomous organization that governed
the project's priorities had decided to allocate so many resources to Addison:
she had an almost garrulous enthusiasm that was absolutely necessary to
effectively herd cats.  Feyerabend was reminded of a busy but sociable doctor.


Feyerabend dimly recognized that she was attractive, something she had not
expected.  Chemical castration  Chemical castration

<hr>

A very clear, discrete presence in her mind, at a very precise point.

"That's a qualia," said Addison, laughing.

The protagonist interacts with the other character via a computer program they
wrote.

Now in the world there was the wordless voice of her thoughts, the swell and
grind of her emotions, and this new third fast whisper.  It communicated clearly





The story ends without any major conflict, merely technical challenges and a
"difficult conversation" that exposes difficult realities that the characters
must confront.
