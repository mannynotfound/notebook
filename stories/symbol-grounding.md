# Symbol Grounding

*An upstanding young programmer acts as the test subject of a new "direct
semantic IO" machine.*

Feyerabend received an invitation to spend the next year working with Emma Chen
and her team, and immediately responded.  She got up from her desk and walked to
the kitchen, her upper body dancing to the pop music playing on the office
soundsystem.  It was a Friday evening in early fall, and things felt heavenly.

"You're in a good mood," said X.

Even though Feyerabend would be living in Poland for over a year, it felt like
she was going on an exciting vacation.  

They gave her a whole week to 'get situated' in her new apartment.  An email
from Emma Chen explicitly suggested that she not do any work.  Feyerabend
decided to go along with this, and had a really relaxing week.  Her new
apartment was quite large, with three bedrooms and two bathrooms.  The build
quality of the fixtures and furniture wasn't amazing, but it was spacious and
comfortable.

The protagonist takes chemical castration medication, and is a pretty
upstanding, idealistic person.  The world in general is an improved, a positive
late capitalism.  

He coworkers were always very concerned about 'business value' and 'making
things work', something that seemed dull to Feyeraband.  They were building
something that had been built, contributing no new understanding to the world.

You can't start a fire You can't start a fire without a spark This gun's for
hire Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Her work, her contribution mattered! 


The protagonist interacts with the other character via a computer program they
wrote.

Choosing the gender of the characters seems very difficult, critical.

A very clear, discrete presence in his mind, at a very precise point.

Now in the world there was the voice of her thoughts, the swell and grind of her
emotions, and this new third fast whisper.  It communicated clearly

The story ends without any major conflict, merely technical challenges and a
"difficult conversation" that exposes difficult realities that the characters
must confront.
