Feyerabend received an invitation to spend the next year working with Emma Chen
and her team, and immediately responded that she was interested, and forwarded
the email to her parents.  She got up from her desk and walked to the office
kitchen, her upper body dancing to the pop music that someone was playing.  It
was a Friday evening in early fall, and things felt heavenly.

Her work, her contribution mattered!  Fears of having a void life were gone for
good now.

An intern is used the test subject for a new "direct semantic IO" machine.

The protagonist takes chemical castration medication, and is a pretty
upstanding, idealistic person.  The world in general is much improved, a
positive late capitalism.

The story ends without any major conflict, merely technical challenges and a
"difficult conversation" that exposes difficult realities that the characters
must confront.

There are only a few computers in the world. 

The protagonist interacts with the other character via a computer program they
wrote.

Choosing the gender of the characters seems very difficult, critical.
