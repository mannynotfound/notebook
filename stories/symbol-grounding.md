# Symbol Grounding

*An upstanding young programmer serves as the test subject of a new "direct
semantic IO" machine.*

When Feyerabend received an invitation to spend the next year working with
Addison Chen and her team in Poland, she responded immediately, and pushed
herself away from her desk. She walked to the kitchen, her upper body dancing to
the pop music on the office soundsystem.  

"You're in a good mood," said Roberto.  He was sitting at an awkwardly shaped
plastic table, working on a terminal.

"Yes," replied Feyerabend.  "A project I've been working on is going well."

"Nice!"  Roberto looked back down at his computer, squinting in the autumn
sunset light.

Feyerabend got pita chips and hummus, and went to another table to think.

This was probably be the best moment of her life, Feyerabend thought.  This was
it, and it was really good.  This was everything paying off at once.

Feyerabend had spent ten years at University, studying grammar.  Whenever her
classmates had gone out to jobs, they'd always treated her with a sort of pity,
asking passive-aggressive questions like "what applications do you see for this
research?", etc.

And now she felt validated: Addison Chen's direct semantic IO project was
valuable, and apparently her contributions to it were also valuable.  She would
contribute new understanding to the world.  Feyerabend felt more certain of this
than anything else in the world, and this meant that a deep dark hole in her
life was now filled with gold.  She had experienced irreversible steps forward
in the past, and this was the biggest one.  She would never feel truly useless
again, when she was having trouble falling asleep.

Feyerabend cleaned up her snack, and went back to her desk.  A notification was
waiting for her, saying that $20,000 had been deposited to her account for
relocation costs.  Feyerabend was impressed that the organization somehow knew
her bank account number, and was able to move money to it instantly. 

<hr>

Even though Feyerabend would be living in Poland for over a year, it felt like
she was going on an exciting vacation.  The HR people at her company sort of
nodded and smiled when she explained she was leaving to work on an open source
project, with people she had never met.  

When Feyerabend arrived in Warsaw, an email from Addison Chen explicitly
suggested that she spend a week not working and 'getting situated'.  Feyerabend
decided to go along with this.  Her new apartment was quite large, with three
bedrooms and two bathrooms, set back from the road in a stand of oak trees.  The
build quality of the fixtures and furniture wasn't amazing, but it was new,
spacious and comfortable.

The next day was warm and summery, and Feyerabend decided to go to one of the
outdoor swimming pools she had seen on the ride from the airport.  She sat on a
towel, reading a non-grammar-related book.  It was the first time Feyerabend had
taken a serious, unstructured break in her life.   She watched families grilling
things and jumping in the pool together.  

Feyerabend wondered what it would be like meeting Addison on Monday.  It
probably wouldn't be particularly uncomfortable: there would be so many things
to talk about.  The abstract synatax tree, the results of the hardware tests,
Feyerabend's whitepaper proposal for a codepoint plane.  

It might be a bit weird, but Feyerabend was experienced with meeting colleagues
from the Internet.  She found that most people were not surprised that she was
trans: to most people, it was sort of obvious from the picture on her website.
The communication problems would work themselves out.

<hr>

Spending most of the day in the sun, wandering around the pastel and grey city,
reminded Feyerabend of being a teenager.  Feyerabend knew that she was still
young in the abstract sense, but her week of freedom brought back memories of a
different period of her life, when there was much more time.  Ever since her
early twenties, Feyerabend had been constantly aware that each day could not be
wasted, and had generally lived accordingly.  It was only out of obedience to
the project that she was going through with this week off.

She drank at dinner alone, and gave the cab driver a slip of paper with her
address on it.  Back in her strange apartment, she looked at herself in the
mirror and quieted old dysphoric feelings. 

A sense of baseless anxiety, like she had taken some sort of speedy drug and was
trying to convince herself that everything was okay.

<hr>

Shortly after sunrise on Monday morning, a driver picked Feyerabend up from her
apartment.  Feyerabend fell asleep in the car, and startled awake when they
arrived.  The driver laughed, and led her into a marble building enclosed by a
glass atrium.

Feyerabend was shown directly to her new office, a room with a bookshelf, a
coffee table, and a set of excellent digital windows.  The driver left, and
Feyerabend spent a few minutes organizing the things in her bag.

Someone pushed open the door, and stuck only his head in.

"Leah?" the person said.  He had a French accent.

"Hello," said Feyerabend, standing up.  

The person introduced himself, saying that he was also a researcher.  He
awkwardly suggested that they go to a meeting room, and asked Feyerabend what
she thought about Warsaw. 

"The people working on the project go out for dinner together, sometimes, I like
that," he said.

Talk shifted quickly to their work.  The researcher said that he mostly worked
on the project's hardware, but that he had read through all of Feyerabend's
RFCs, and thought they were all very well-considered. 

"Do you have any insight into whether I'll be involved with the hardware aspect
of the project or not?" asked Feyerabend.

"Well, you'll be working with the hardware almost constantly.  That's the main
reason why the organization decided to fund your residency here."

"It's not an area I have much expertise in," said Feyerabend, somewhat
excitedly.  The researcher smiled.

"We've developed a fairly straightforward user interface for the focused
ultrasound CBI machine, I'll be interested in your feedback on it."

"Looking forward to providing it," said Feyerabend.

"Why don't we go take a look at it?"

"The CBI device?  Now?" 

"Sure," said the French researcher.  "Let's not waste any time.  There's some
safety training you'll have to do, but that doesn't apply to use of the CBI."

Feyerabend was very excited about the prospect of a whole year with a
medical-grade computer-brain interface.  At university, she had worked with
transcranial magnetic stimulation machines, and an Internet friend had once
shown her a focused ultrasound effector designed for use on rats, but recent
tests with the project's focused ultrasound device had suggested spatial and
temporaral resolutions orders of magnitude higher than legacy devices.
Feyerabend's proposals depended on the reality of this hardware.

On the way to see the machine, the French researcher showed her the break room,
containing only a refrigerator and a coffee machine.  The room containing the
focused ultrasound CBI machine was similar.  It was not yet encased in white
medical plastic: it looked like a delicate industrial robot, with a large number
of modular microprocessor boards connected to custom mechanical components.

"Here it is!" said the French researcher.  "We have a few others, but this is
the latest iteration."

The researcher gave her a tour of the machine's components.  There were few
surprises.  As he was finishing up, an older woman came into the room, saying
"Hello!" loudly to announce herself.

"Leah, meet Addison," said the French researcher.

"Wow," said Feyerabend, shaking Addison's hand lightly.  "Really great to meet
to you in person, finally."  Feyerabend dimly recognized that Addison was
attractive, something she had not expected.  Feyerabend took chemical
sterilization medication, drugs that she had initially purchased from the
darknet, but now had a prescription for.

It was quickly obvious why the distributed autonomous organization that governed
the project had decided to allocate so many resources to Addison: she had the
almost garrulous enthusiasm required to effectively herd neuroscientists,
electrical engineers, and programmers.  Feyerabend was reminded of a busy but
sociable dentist, as Addison outlined the plan for the next few weeks.  Tomorrow
morning, Feyerabend could start testing the CBI machine, and would have a week
to simply experiment with it, under the supervision of Addison herself.  Then,
they would devise a research plan.

<hr>

That evening, Feyerabend asked her driver to drop her off at a restaurant near
her apartment, and treated herself to a celebratory meal.  She tried to think
back to the last time she was truly unhappy.  It was almost scary, the thought
that her work could be so perfect, so fulfilling.  It seemed that with a decent
stack of genetics, environment, and consistent effort, it is possible to be
happy virtually all of the time.  If you build your life on top of robust
systems like Soylent, Adderall, TalkSpace, SoulCycle, ReactJS, Ketamine, GitHub,
and Harvest, almost nothing can ruin your life, except for a few thorny edge
cases.  But those are what make life beautiful :). 



The only thing that seemed comparable, at least in terms of novelty, was when
she had experienced the confusion of her first orgasm around the age of
thirteen.  But this was a much quieter, more precise version of that feeling.

A very clear, discrete presence in her mind, at a very precise point.

"That's a qualia," said Addison, laughing.

The protagonist interacts with the other character via a computer program they
wrote.

Now in the world there was the wordless voice of her thoughts, the swell and
grind of her emotions, and this new third fast whisper.  It communicated clearly





The story ends without any major conflict, merely technical challenges and a
"difficult conversation" that exposes difficult realities that the characters
must confront.
