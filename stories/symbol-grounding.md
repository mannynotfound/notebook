# Symbol Grounding

*An upstanding young programmer serves as the test subject of a new "direct
semantic IO" machine.*

When Feyerabend received an invitation to spend the next year working with
Addison Chen and her team in Poland, she responded immediately, and pushed
herself away from her desk. She walked to the kitchen, her upper body dancing to
the pop music on the office soundsystem.  

"You're in a good mood," said Roberto.  He was sitting at an awkwardly shaped
plastic table, working on a terminal.

"Yes," replied Feyerabend.  "A project I've been working on is going well."

"Nice!"  Roberto looked back down at his computer, squinting in the autumn
sunset light.

Feyerabend got pita chips and hummus, and went to another table to think.

This was probably be the best moment of her life, Feyerabend thought.  This was
it, and it was really good.  This was everything paying off at once.

Feyerabend had spent ten years at University, studying grammar.  Whenever her
classmates had gone out to jobs, they'd always treated her with a sort of pity,
asking passive-aggressive questions like "what applications do you see for this
research?", etc.

And now she felt validated: Addison Chen's direct semantic IO project was
valuable, and apparently her contributions to it were also valuable.  She would
contribute new understanding to the world.  Feyerabend felt more certain of this
than anything else in the world, and this meant that a deep dark hole in her
life was now filled with gold.  She had experienced irreversible steps forward
in the past, and this was the biggest one.  She would never feel truly useless
again, when she was having trouble falling asleep.

Feyerabend cleaned up her snack, and went back to her desk.  A notification was
waiting for her, saying that $20,000 had been deposited to her account for
relocation costs.  Feyerabend was impressed that the organization somehow knew
her bank account number, and was able to move money to it instantly.

Even though Feyerabend would be living in Poland for over a year, it felt like
she was going on an exciting vacation.  The HR people at her company sort of
nodded and smiled when she explained she was leaving to work on an open source
project, with people she had never met.  

When Feyerabend arrived in Warsaw, an email from Addison Chen explicitly
suggested that she spend a week not working and 'getting situated'.  Feyerabend
decided to go along with this.  Her new apartment was quite large, with three
bedrooms and two bathrooms, set back from the road in a stand of oak trees.  The
build quality of the fixtures and furniture wasn't amazing, but it was new,
spacious and comfortable.

The next day was warm and summery, and Feyerabend decided to go to one of the
outdoor swimming pools she had seen on the ride from the airport.  She sat on a
towel, reading a non-grammar-related book.  It was the first time Feyerabend had
taken a serious, unstructured break in her life.   She watched families grilling
things and jumping in the pool together.  

Feyerabend wondered what it would be like meeting Addison on Monday.  It
probably wouldn't be particularly uncomfortable: there would be so many things
to talk about.  The abstract synatax tree, the results of the hardware tests,
Feyerabend's whitepaper proposal for a codepoint plane.  

It might be a bit weird, but Feyerabend was experienced with meeting colleagues
from the Internet.  She found that most people were not surprised that she was
trans: to most people, it was sort of obvious from the picture on her website.
The communication problems would work themselves out.

Spending most of the day in the sun, wandering around the pastel and grey city,
reminded Feyerabend of being a teenager.  Feyerabend knew that she was still
young in the abstract sense, but her week of freedom brought back memories of a
different period of her life, when there was much more time.  Ever since her
early twenties, Feyerabend had been constantly aware that each day could not be
wasted, and had generally lived accordingly.  It was only out of obedience to
the project that she was going through with this week off.

She drank at dinner alone, and gave the cab driver a slip of paper with her
address on it.  Back in her strange apartment, she looked at herself in the
mirror and quieted old dysphoric feelings. 

A sense of baseless anxiety, like she had taken some sort of speedy drug and was
trying to convince herself that everything was okay.

On Monday morning, a driver picked Feyerabend up from her apartment a little bit
after sunrise.

The driver led her through a glowing marble building enclosed in a glass atrium.

The protagonist takes chemical castration medication, and is a pretty
upstanding, idealistic person.  The world in general is an improved, a positive
late capitalism.  
A very clear, discrete presence in his mind, at a very precise point.

"That's a qualia," said Addison, laughing.

The protagonist interacts with the other character via a computer program they
wrote.

Now in the world there was the wordless voice of her thoughts, the swell and
grind of her emotions, and this new third fast whisper.  It communicated clearly





The story ends without any major conflict, merely technical challenges and a
"difficult conversation" that exposes difficult realities that the characters
must confront.
