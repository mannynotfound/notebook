Cornell

The day my parents drove me to college, I was wearing a red polo shirt.  
While carrying things up to my room, I saw a pretty Indian girl waiting in the
sun.  Seeing her made me feel anxious about what college would bring, and
whether I would get what I want. //dreams?  live out?

After walking around campus with my mom and sisters, getting my ID card and
some books, I went to a dining hall with my dad.  He wanted to talk.

The sun was already setting and the dining hall was filled with fall evening
oranges and reds.  There were many other new students and their parents talking
loudly.  My dad happily got chocolate milk from the stainless steel "milk
udder" and we sat down and ate.

The next day was my first day at college.  It was another nice day.  I stayed in bed
for a while, feeling good.  I evaluated the night before.  It seemed like a
good start, even though I didn't meet someone.  I figured I'd have to work
towards that.  

After spending some time on my the internet I went to the dining hall and started to
work on the reading assignment that all Cornell freshman were supposed to read.
I had read the book had not really started writing the
essay.  The essay would be judged as part of a contest with a $200 gift card
for the ten winners.  The book that year was "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?".  I
felt sort of like Harrison Ford.  I felt like I would eventually be
something like one of his characters.  If I was special.  

I ate pancakes and took notes on the book.  I was alone but happy to be alone
imagining that someone would sit down next to me.  There were people in groups
but I didn't quite envy them the same way that I would envy people in groups at
night, drinking.
