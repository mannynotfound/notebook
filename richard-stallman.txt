IT'S TOO LATE WHAT THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO.  START OVER?
WELL IF I DON'T START OVER THEY'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND ANYTHING THEY WON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S ABOUT!
WHAT THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?  THERE'S NO OPTION!  
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU THINK.  WHAT YOU THINK I'M GOING TO DO.  
IT'S ALL USELESS IT'S FAILED ALREADY.  IT'S IRREVOCABLY FAILED.  I GIVE UP.
FUCK IT.  THIS HAS BEEN TOTALLY USELESS.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU THINK I COULD POSSIBLY DO THAT WOULD HELP THEM.
IF THEY MISSED THE FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT PART OF MY SPEECH, THE REST IS GOING TO BE TOTALLY POINTLESS ANYWAY.
I REALLY DON'T SEE ANY POINT IT'S TOO LATE, DON'T YOU SEE?  
I GIVE UP I CAN'T STAND THIS.  I JUST CAN'T ~STAND~ THIS.
THERE IS NO PRACTICAL OPTION.  IT'S USELESS NOW, IT'S RUINED.  I GIVE UP, I WANT TO GIVE UP BECAUSE IT'S RUINED.
TOO LATE!  DON'T YOU SEE?  DAMN.  DAMN.  PLEASE TURN OFF THE CAMERA I DON'T WANT A RECORDING OF THIS.  
I REALLY DON'T WANT A RECORDING PLEASE STOP.  PLEASE STOP.  STOP.  STOP.  STOP.
I  DON'T   WANT     RECORDINGS OF   THIS.  I'M SORRY.  THIS IS HORRIBLE.
DON'T YOU SEE HOW _HORRIBLE_ THIS IS.   YEAH I FEEL THAT EVERYTHING I DO IS USELESS BECAUSE IT'S FAILURE.  
TOTAL HORRIBLE FAILURE WHAT THE HELL CAN I DO NOW.  
I JUST FEEL SO HORRIBLE.  I FEEL SO HORRIBLE I.  I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET MYSELF BACK INTO THINKING ABOUT ANYTHING BUT HOW HORRIBLE THIS IS.  SO.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW PAINFUL IT FEELS TO HAVE A FAILURE.  AND SO MANY THINGS HAVE MESSED UP LATELY I FEEL TOTALLY TERRIBLE.  SO I'LL TRY TO MAKE MYSELF CONTINUE.
