Sailors and sailing have haunted me since I was a teenager.
Sailing people are subtly some of the weirdest, most divorced from reality people there are.
Sometime in early August Connor Godfrey asked if I wanted to crew for him on Thursday evening after work, at Larchmont Yacht Club, in Larchmont, New York.  They raced vangaurd 15's there, which were appealing to me.   When we were about twelve Connor Mangan and I had made fun of Connor Godfrey a lot, for not being as good of sailors as us, and for always looking like a baby, with a round face and many freckles.

On Wednesday night I did "very speedy" Molly before I went to a Yung Lean concert.  I felt bad being around my girlfriend and wanted to finally break up with her, or at least leave the concert, which I wasn't really feeling, even though I liked Yung Lean.  

Fucked up guy without a face and idk even rly but I look away and everyone else looks away lol.
I can't even post a facebook status about these sailor people, that's how much power they have over me.

People who play cellphone games with loud sound on the subway.  
Inevitably FAT.

I left the concert early and felt sad on the "train" ride home.  But when I got home I felt better.  I went on my computer for a bit and then shut off the monitors at 1 am and got in bed.  But I couldn't really sleep.  I slept for a bit but then woke up because I had to pee.

I decided I might as well work on the open source pHash project on my computer instead of futilely trying to sleep.  Stole roommates beer.
